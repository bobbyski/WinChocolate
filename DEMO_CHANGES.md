# Demo changes

A running log of changes to the **shared demo** (`Demo/DemoApplication/`) — the one
source tree that must compile and run unmodified against all three targets:

| Target | Framework | Built by |
|---|---|---|
| macOS | real Apple AppKit | `./run-mac.sh` |
| Windows | WinChocolate (Win32) | `buildandrun.bat` |
| Linux | LinChocolate (GTK4) | `LinChocolate/run-linux.sh` |

## The rules these changes follow

1. **No shims.** Ever. Set in stone. A demo that only compiles via a compatibility
   layer proves nothing.
2. **No framework changes in this phase.** Fixes land in the demo only. Where a demo
   line reached for a non-Apple spelling, it is rewritten against plain AppKit. (This
   rule starts at the *Flip every demo view* entry below. The two backfilled entries
   beneath it predate it and are marked as such — one of them did change the
   frameworks, because the API it needed did not exist.)
3. **Plain AppKit must be sufficient.** Anything written here must be real AppKit API,
   so it means the same thing on all three targets.

Where a divergence is genuinely the *framework's* fault rather than the demo's, it is
recorded in [`Docs/AppKitFaithfulnessIssues.md`](Docs/AppKitFaithfulnessIssues.md)
instead — that document tracks framework remediation (Phase 18); this one tracks the
demo.

## How to add an entry

Newest first. Each entry states the symptom, the root cause, the fix, and **how it was
verified** — running the demo, not just building it.

## Control reference: `NSDatePicker`

Reference for the control as it now stands, because its behaviour was rebuilt from measured
AppKit rather than assumption and the reasoning is worth keeping. The chronological story is
in *Follow-up 2/4/5* under the geometry entry below; this is the summary of **what it does
and why**.

### Ground truth (measured, not guessed)

Everything here was read out of **real AppKit** with a throwaway probe on the Mac —
`swiftc probe.swift && ./probe` — printing the API and rendering the control to a PNG with
`bitmapImageRepForCachingDisplay` + `cacheDisplay(in:to:)`. Guessing was wrong on every one
of these:

| Question | Answer from real AppKit |
|---|---|
| Default style | `.textFieldAndStepper` — a field **with a stepper** |
| Field text for `[.yearMonthDay, .hourMinuteSecond]` | `5/31/2026, 8:00:00 PM` (en_US, local zone) |
| Where that format comes from | a locale **template**, not a style — a 4-digit year, which `.short` (`5/31/26`) cannot produce |
| `stringValue` | `Sunday, May 31, 2026 at 8:00:00 PM Eastern Daylight Time` — i.e. `DateFormatter(dateStyle: .full, timeStyle: .full)`, and **independent of `datePickerElements`** |
| `objectValue` | the `Date` |
| `formatter` / `locale` / `calendar` / `timeZone` | all `nil` by default |
| `intrinsicContentSize` | varies with style **and elements**: `(180, 22)` for `.textFieldAndStepper` with date+time, `(95, 22)` date-only, `(275.5, 148)` for `.clockAndCalendar` — **not implemented here** (see *Not done*) |

`DateFormatter.dateFormat(fromTemplate: "Mdyyyyjmmss", options: 0, locale: .current)` →
`M/d/yyyy, h:mm:ss a` → reproduces AppKit's render exactly. Linux Foundation returns
**byte-identical** output to macOS for this, for full/full, and for `Calendar` arithmetic —
which is what makes a shared implementation possible.

### Element flags — Apple's real values

The previous values were invented (`1 << 0`, `1 << 1`, …) and one member,
`yearMonthDayEra`, **does not exist in AppKit at all**. Apple's:

| Flag | Raw | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| `.hourMinute` | `0x000c` | |
| `.hourMinuteSecond` | `0x000e` | **contains** `.hourMinute` |
| `.timeZone` | `0x0010` | |
| `.yearMonth` | `0x00c0` | |
| `.yearMonthDay` | `0x00e0` | **contains** `.yearMonth` |
| `.era` | `0x0100` | Apple's spelling — not `yearMonthDayEra` |

They are **cumulative**, so always test the wider flag first (`.yearMonthDay` before
`.yearMonth`). Compiling proves nothing about raw values: symbolic use worked fine while
every literal was wrong.

### Architecture: the framework owns the date, the backend renders it

The original split had the *backend* formatting the date — which put locale, calendar, time
zone and element flags, all AppKit semantics, inside GTK. Now:

**`NSDatePicker` (framework)** builds the pattern from the elements, renders it, records each
field's character range as a `Segment` (component + step + pattern letter), tracks the
selected field, steps and types into it via `Calendar`, clamps to `minDate`/`maxDate`, and
formats `stringValue`. Its public surface stays **Apple-exact** — no `segments` or
`displayText` leak out; tests observe the backend seam instead.

**The backend** only renders and reports:

| Seam | Direction | Meaning |
|---|---|---|
| `setDatePickerText(_:for:)` | → backend | show exactly this text |
| `setDatePickerSelection(location:length:for:)` | → backend | highlight this range |
| `setDateStepAction(for:action:)` | ← backend | the stepper moved (+1/-1) — *which* field that means is the framework's call |
| `setDatePickerCursorAction(for:action:)` | ← backend | a click landed at this character offset |
| `setDatePickerMoveAction(for:action:)` | ← backend | ←/→ pressed |
| `setDatePickerTypeAction(for:action:)` | ← backend | this character was typed |
| `setDateValue(_:for:)` | → backend | only `.clockAndCalendar` needs the value natively |
| `setDateRange(min:max:for:)` | → backend | recorded for parity; the framework does the authoritative clamping |

### Behaviour

- **Styles.** `.textFieldAndStepper` = field + stepper. `.clockAndCalendar` = GtkCalendar.
  Switching rebuilds the widget and re-applies both the value and the change action (the old
  swap dropped both).
- **The stepper** is two arrow buttons **stacked, up above down** — Apple's control, shared
  with `NSStepper` via `makeStepperArrows(onStep:)`. It edits **the selected field**, not
  always the day.
- **Selection.** Click a field to select it; ←/→ move between fields. A click on a separator
  picks the field to its left.
- **Typing.** Digits accumulate into the selected field (`4` `5` → `45`). The selection
  auto-advances when the field is full **or when no further digit could be valid** — no month
  starts with `4`, so `4` commits April and hops to the day. A digit that can't extend the run
  starts a fresh value (`3` `5` on the day = the 5th, not "35"). A leading zero is held, not
  rejected (`0` `7` = July). The year takes 4 digits. `a`/`p` set AM/PM. Typing an hour on a
  12-hour clock keeps the current half-day. Typing fires the action.
- **Day clamping.** Setting a month/year can strand an impossible day (April 31). `Calendar`
  would roll that into May 1; AppKit clamps to the month's last day — which is what stepping
  already does (May 31 + 1 month = June 30). Typing and stepping now agree.
- **`minDate`/`maxDate`** clamp for real (framework-side). They were no-op stubs.

### Traps this control taught (all cost real time)

1. **`gtk_widget_set_size_request` is a *minimum*.** A GtkSpinButton's ~120px minimum made a
   20×28 `NSStepper` overrun and cover its own value label. See the geometry entry.
2. **GTK batches the entry's cursor notifications** and delivers them *after*
   `set_text`/`select_region` return — so the field re-reports its own selection outside any
   suppression window. Resetting the typed run on every report swallowed the second digit
   (`45` → `05`). Only a *change* of field abandons a run. `LINCHOCOLATE_DATE_DEBUG=1` traces
   these; this class will recur.
3. **ICU emits U+202F** (narrow no-break space) before AM/PM, on macOS and Linux alike. Test
   literals typed with a plain space fail against correct code and look identical in a
   terminal. Source spells `\u{202F}`. When every "got" value looks right but the check fails,
   dump `unicodeScalars`.
4. **Calendar arithmetic doesn't round-trip** and shouldn't: May 31 +1 month = June 30, and
   back = May **30**. A test asserting otherwise was the test's bug.

### Verified

Contract tests pin the format, `stringValue`, Apple's raw flag values and their cumulativity,
per-field stepping, typing (accumulate, auto-advance, restart, leading zero, AM/PM,
day-clamping, the cursor-echo regression), and min/max clamping. Driven live under Xvfb: the
year click + step → 2026→2028; typing `4` `5` → `8:45`, `5` `9` → `8:45:59`; month `1` `2` →
December with the day clamped to the 31st, the weekday recomputed, and the zone flipping to
Eastern **Standard** Time.

### Not done

- **`intrinsicContentSize` is not overridden**, so it falls back to `NSView`'s default while
  AppKit reports `(180, 22)` / `(95, 22)` / `(275.5, 148)` depending on style and elements
  (probed). `LayoutSolver` reads `intrinsicContentSize`, and `NSTextField` already overrides
  it — so a date picker under Auto Layout would size wrong. The demo places its pickers at
  explicit frames, which is why this doesn't bite today. ~~Same gap in WinChocolate.~~
  **Closed on WinChocolate 2026-07-16** (Round 5): it returns the three probed sizes for the
  configurations Apple was measured in, and measures the rest rather than guessing.
- The stepper steps a whole unit; AppKit also supports dragging. Not implemented.
- `.era` and `.timeZone` fields render but are not steppable/typable (no sensible unit).
- `datePickerMode` (single vs range) is still an accepted no-op in `DemoCompat`.
- ~~**WinChocolate half untouched**: same invented flags
  (`Sources/WinChocolate/Controls/NSDatePicker.swift:21`), no locale-template format, no
  full/full `stringValue`, no selected-element stepping, no typing.~~ **Done 2026-07-16** —
  see *Windows re-sync — Round 5* in
  [`Docs/AppKitFaithfulnessIssues.md`](Docs/AppKitFaithfulnessIssues.md). WinChocolate keeps
  the native `SysDateTimePick32` (Windows *has* a date field; GTK does not) and configures
  it: `DTS_UPDOWN` gives `.textFieldAndStepper` the stepper it is named for, and the control
  natively selects, steps and types into the element — the behaviours this list demands. The
  framework owns the AppKit semantics: Apple's cumulative flags, the locale-driven format,
  the clamp, the zone, and full/full `stringValue`. Live-verified to the same results
  recorded here for Linux (year 2026→2028 with the label recomputing to Wednesday; month
  typed `1` `2` → December, day 31, weekday Sunday).

## 2026-07-17 — The Tables-page collection was empty on macOS: a bare NSCollectionView never materializes (demo fix)

Bobby: *"the collections buttons are not showing in the mac demo app."* Confirmed on the
real app — the Tables/Media page rendered everything except the collection: "Collection:"
beside an empty void where six buttons belong. **On Linux the same demo rendered them
fine**, so this was a Mac-only demo bug.

### Diagnosis — on the live app, not probes

Offscreen probes proved worthless here: a CLI accessory app never drives AppKit's real
display cycle, so probe collections behaved differently from the app's (both false
positives and false negatives — an afternoon of contradictory results). What worked:
**attach lldb to the running demo and dump `_subtreeDescription`** of the content view.
That showed, in one run of one app:

- Tables-page collection `f=(152,226,392,96)`: only child an `NSVisualEffectView` (its
  background). **Zero items.**
- Lists-page collection (hidden page!): **full of item buttons.**

So hidden/visible was irrelevant; item construction was irrelevant (both sources build raw
`NSCollectionViewItem()` + `NSButton` — both work). Diffing the two setups and testing each
candidate **on the real app** (edit → rebuild → lldb dump):

| candidate | result |
|---|---|
| `reloadData()` after joining the hierarchy | still empty |
| layout assigned before dataSource (the Lists order) | still empty |
| **collection as an `NSScrollView`'s `documentView`** | **all six buttons materialize** |

### Root cause

**A bare `NSCollectionView` added directly as a subview never materializes its items on
macOS.** The enclosing `NSScrollView`'s clip view drives the visible-rect machinery that
prepares items; without it the collection lays out nothing, silently — no assert, no log.
Apple's documentation says to embed collection views in scroll views; the Lists-page
collection did, the Tables-page one didn't. (LinChocolate's GTK collection carries its own
internal scroller, which is why Linux never showed the bug.)

### Fix (demo)

The Tables collection now mirrors the Lists structure: `collectionScrollView` wraps the
collection as its `documentView` at the same frame `(152,226,392,96)`; layout → dataSource
→ documentView → reload, matching the working page.

**Verified:** live subtree on macOS shows all six buttons flowed in two rows
(`NSButton (4,4)`, `NSTextField (138,4)`, `NSTableView (272,4)`, `NSImageView (4,40)`, …);
Linux renders the same six through the wrapper (LinChocolate's `NSScrollView.documentView`
passes the collection through); geometry audit **0 violations on all 11 pages**; all
contract tests pass.

**Two lessons for the log:**
- Collections cannot be probed from CLI accessory apps — materialization needs the real
  display cycle. **lldb `_subtreeDescription` on the live app** is the reliable instrument.
- An empty-but-silent NSCollectionView means "no enclosing scroll view" before it means
  anything about your data source.

**MUST FIX (WinChocolate, untestable here):** the demo now parents this collection via
`NSScrollView.documentView` — its scroll view must pass a collection document view through
(LinChocolate's does).

## 2026-07-16 — Closing a panel no longer closes (or crashes) the app (framework work; demo untouched)

Bobby: *"Closing the Panel closes the app (or crashes it) — can you address that?"* Both
symptoms were real, from two stacked faults in the close path:

1. **Every window's close button called `NSApplication.terminate`** — the old
   "single-window convenience" (its own comment admitted the divergence). So the floating
   inspector panel's X took the whole app down.
2. **GTK then destroyed the window anyway**: the `close-request` trampoline returned
   FALSE ("not handled"), so after our callback GTK proceeded with destruction. The demo
   *reuses* its panel (`inspectorPanel` is kept and re-fronted), so the next "Panel" click
   presented a destroyed GtkWindow — the crash.

**The fix — Apple's semantics:**
- The title-bar X routes through **`performClose(_:)`** (AppKit's path), which calls the
  new **`close()`**: the window **hides** (`hideWindow` seam → `gtk_widget_set_visible 0`);
  the native window survives. Under ARC, an NSWindow the app still references can be
  re-presented with `orderFrontRegardless`/`makeKeyAndOrderFront` — exactly what the
  demo's reusable panel does, and now does without crashing.
- The trampoline returns TRUE: the close is ours, GTK destroys nothing.
- `isVisible` is tracked (AppKit's property), and `orderOut(_:)` is real. The old no-op
  stubs for `close`/`orderOut`/`performClose` in DemoCompat are gone.
- **Termination policy**: the app quits when the **last visible window** closes. (Apple
  keeps an app alive at zero windows — menu-bar-only, per
  `applicationShouldTerminateAfterLastWindowClosed`. GTK has no menu-bar-only mode:
  in-window menus die with the last window, so staying alive would strand a headless
  process. Documented divergence until the delegate policy lands.)

**Verified live** (xdotool, Xvfb): open Panel → close its X → **app alive**, main window
untouched → click Panel again → **the same panel re-presents, no crash** → close the main
window → **clean exit**. Contract tests pin all four: a panel's X hides the panel and the
app keeps running; the native window is hidden not destroyed; the closed panel
re-presents; the last visible window closing terminates. All contract tests pass;
geometry audit still 0 violations on all 11 pages.

**MUST FIX (WinChocolate):** same close semantics if it terminates on any window's X —
close closes the window; last-visible-window terminates; reusable panels must re-present.

## 2026-07-16 — The nib panel unified: ONE implementation, identifier-wired (demo led; framework parity work)

`DemoNibConveniences.swift` was the last demo file with a behavior `#if`: a full
platform split — `@IBOutlet`/`@IBAction` auto-binding on macOS vs reading the xib's
connection records on the Chocolates. Ruling: *"NO #if conditionals other than the
AppKit/chocolate selector."* Rebuilt as one implementation.

**The unified wiring model: identifier lookup, pure AppKit.** Every control in
`DemoNibPanel.xib` already carries an Identity-inspector identifier. The panel is
instantiated through Apple's `NSNib` API with a **nil owner**, and each control is
resolved by walking the view tree comparing `NSView.identifier` — the manual-wiring
pattern AppKit apps use in place of outlets. No File's-Owner controller, no
`@IBOutlet`/`@IBAction`, nothing needing the ObjC runtime. Behaviors (Increment,
Show Values, slider) wire through the demo's own seam-free `onAction`.

Two more platform-shaped differences dissolved without conditionals:
- **Compiled nib vs XML xib**: AppKit instantiates only compiled nibs; the Chocolates
  read the IB XML. The demo takes `DemoNibPanel.nib` when the file exists (run-mac.sh
  compiles it) and falls back to the `.xib` — a file-presence check, not a platform check.
- **Owner connections**: the xib still declares its historical File's-Owner
  outlets/actions; with a nil owner AppKit skips them (messages to nil) and the
  Chocolate readers resolve them to nothing. **Probed on real AppKit**: nil-owner
  instantiate returns true, no throw.

**Framework parity work this rode on (LinChocolate):**
- `NSView.identifier` migrated `String?` → **`NSUserInterfaceItemIdentifier?`** — Apple's
  exact type (closes Issue E). Fallout: NibDecoder wraps, NSCollectionView's reuse
  assignments drop `.rawValue`.
- `NSNib.instantiate(withOwner:topLevelObjects:)` gained Apple's call shape: an
  `inout NSArray?` overload, so the shared line `var topLevel: NSArray?` +
  `&topLevel` compiles against Darwin's `AutoreleasingUnsafeMutablePointer<NSArray?>?`
  and here alike.

**Verified:**
- **macOS, at runtime** (not just typecheck): ibtool-compiled the xib, probe loads it with
  nil owner → instantiate true, **all 7 identifiers resolve**, and a real
  `button.performClick` dispatches the `moveUp:` trampoline — the whole unified stack
  proven on genuine AppKit. `swiftc -typecheck` over the demo: 0 errors.
- **Linux**: builds 0 errors; contract tests pass; all 11 pages **0 geometry violations,
  0 dropped children**; the Nib page reports *"7/7 controls resolved by identifier"* and
  two clicks of Increment count **2**.
- **`#if` audit**: every demo file now contains exactly ONE conditional — the import
  selection. (main.swift's other `#if` hits are comments.)

**MUST FIX (WinChocolate, untestable here):** `NSView.identifier` as
`NSUserInterfaceItemIdentifier?`; `NSNib.instantiate(withOwner:topLevelObjects: NSArray?)`
call shape; connection records resolved against a nil owner must no-op; plus the earlier
list (NSResponder `moveUp`/`moveDown` dispatch, `Notification`-typed `textDidChange`,
submit-`onAction`).

## 2026-07-16 — Demo conveniences rebuilt: ONE shared file, one `#if` (the import selection)

The original `DemoConveniences.swift` carried behavior-splitting `#if` seams (`@objc`
dispatch on Darwin vs `perform(_:with:)` off it; `Notification` vs `NSNotification`). Two
rulings shaped the rebuild: *"You can create convenience functions for things like
onAction — so long as they require no platform specifics and work in AppKit too"*, then
*"Mac only is not allowed — same sources, one `#if` for header selection."* (A first cut
that split the trampoline into a Mac-only file is gone; every target compiles the same
file list.)

**The file is back as one shared source whose only `#if` is the import selection.** Two
mechanisms make that possible, both real AppKit:

- **Delegate sugar** (`onTextChanged`, `onSelectionChanged`, `onOutlineSelectionChanged`,
  `onComboBoxTextChanged`): conforming an `NSObject` subclass to an ObjC delegate protocol
  auto-exposes the methods on Darwin — no `@objc` attribute — and the Chocolate frameworks
  declare the same protocols as plain Swift. The `textDidChange` seam collapsed to Apple's
  `Notification` signature (the `NSNotification` spelling was WinChocolate's; its gap now).
- **Target/action sugar** (`onAction` on `NSControl`/`NSMenuItem`/`NSToolbarItem`,
  `NSTableView.onDoubleAction`): the trampoline needs ObjC-visible selectors on Darwin,
  and `@objc` can't compile off Apple — but an **override of an inherited ObjC method is
  implicitly `@objc`**, no attribute in source. So `DemoActionTarget` subclasses
  `NSResponder` and overrides two of Apple's standard key-binding action methods —
  `moveUp(_:)`/`moveDown(_:)`, declared `(Any?) -> Void` no-ops on NSResponder for exactly
  this kind of selector dispatch — and controls' `action` is set to those REAL selectors
  (`Selector(("moveUp:"))`, the attribute-free spelling, valid on all three). On Darwin
  the ObjC runtime dispatches them; on the Chocolates `NSResponder.perform(_:with:)` does.
  The trampoline never joins a responder chain, so nothing else ever sends it these
  selectors.

**LinChocolate grew the Apple-parity slice this rides on** (`Runtime/NSObjectRuntime.swift`):
`NSResponder.moveUp(_:)`/`moveDown(_:)` as open no-ops (`NSStandardKeyBindingResponding`),
plus `responds(to:)`/`perform(_:with:)` mapping those selectors through the vtable — the
table Apple's runtime maintains for free, spelled out. `NSTextField`/`NSForm` submit-
`onAction` (Enter, via the `setSubmitAction` seam) stay from earlier tonight.

**Verified from the SAME sources:**
- **macOS:** `swiftc -typecheck` (run-mac.sh's exact flags) over the demo directory
  against real AppKit — **0 errors**. The override-is-implicitly-`@objc` trampoline is
  compile-checked, not guessed.
- **Linux:** builds 0 errors; contract tests pass headless; all 11 pages render with
  **0 geometry violations, 0 dropped children**; clicking the Click button three times
  counts **Clicks: 3** — GTK click → `sendAction` → `perform("moveUp:")` →
  override → closure, end to end.

Note: the `DemoNibConveniences.swift` symlink is restored in `Sources/RealDemo/` — every
target compiles the same file list, and `main.swift` calls `installDemoNibPanel()`. That
file's `#if` remains the explicitly sanctioned temporary exception for
`@IBOutlet`/`@IBAction` ("you can temporarily #if them till we add them").

**MUST FIX (WinChocolate, untestable here):**
- `NSResponder` needs `moveUp(_:)`/`moveDown(_:)` + the `responds(to:)`/`perform(_:with:)`
  mapping, as LinChocolate now has — the shared trampoline dispatches through it.
- `NSTextViewDelegate.textDidChange` must take `Notification`, not `NSNotification`.
- `NSTextField`/`NSForm` submit-`onAction` (Enter), as LinChocolate has.

## 2026-07-16 — Demo rule cleanup: framework absorbs what the `#if` guards used to hide (framework work; demo led)

The demo was cleaned up to enforce the rule more strictly — **no framework-specific `#if`
blocks in the shared source** beyond the sanctioned `import` and the `@IBOutlet/@IBAction`
code isolated in `DemoNibConveniences.swift`. Commit `8d26203` removed several
Chocolate-only branches. Each removal turned a demo shim into a framework obligation;
LinChocolate had to grow to meet the now-plain-AppKit demo. Four gaps, all fixed
framework-side (demo led, LinChocolate followed):

1. **Backend selection.** The demo used to carry
   `#if canImport(LinChocolate) app.nativeBackend = GTKNativeControlBackend() #endif`.
   Gone — so `NSApplication.shared` must supply the native backend itself. It can't be
   eager: `GTKNativeControlBackend()` calls `gtk_init()`, which **aborts a headless
   process**, and the hermetic contract tests run with no display. Fix:
   `NSApplication.shared.nativeBackend` is **lazily GTK** — built on first *use*, so a test
   that assigns an in-memory backend before creating any control never triggers `gtk_init`.
   Without this the app used the in-memory backend, `runApplication` returned immediately,
   and the window never appeared (silent exit 0 — a nasty symptom, since nothing rendered
   and nothing logged).
2. **`NSForm.cellSize` / `setBezeled` / `setBordered`.** The `#if !canImport(LinChocolate)`
   guard around these was removed, so the demo now calls them unconditionally. Implemented
   on `NSForm`: `cellSize` sets the row height and re-lays existing rows (works before or
   after `addEntry`); `setBezeled`/`setBordered` drive the value fields' border.
3. **`viewDidChangeEffectiveAppearance()`.** The demo overrides AppKit's live-appearance
   hook on its content view. Added as `@MainActor open func` on `NSView` (the base does
   nothing) — its `@MainActor` isolation is also what lets the override call the
   main-actor-isolated `applyLiveAppearanceRefresh()`.
4. **`installDemoNibPanel()`.** The nib code moved out of `main.swift` into a new
   `DemoNibConveniences.swift` (the sanctioned home for ObjC-interop-divergent demo code).
   That file wasn't compiled on Linux — symlinked it into `Sources/RealDemo/`.

Also folded in by the cleanup, needing no framework change: the timer block now updates
synchronously via `MainActor.assumeIsolated` instead of `Task { @MainActor }`, so the
libdispatch-drain from the previous entry is no longer exercised by the demo (kept, as
harmless robustness).

**Verified:** LinChocolate builds (0 errors); contract tests pass **headless** (no
`gtk_init` abort — the lazy backend stays in-memory there); RealDemo renders all 11 pages
under Xvfb with **0 geometry violations, 0 dropped children**; the deprecated NSForm draws
its two bordered rows; the Nib page instantiates `DemoNibPanel.xib`; the timer ticks.

**Gotcha worth keeping:** the shared demo names no backend, so on Linux
`NSApplication.shared` *is* the backend selector — and it must be lazy, or headless tests
`gtk_init`-abort. A silent `exit 0` with a blank window and empty log = the in-memory
backend running (its `runApplication` is a no-op).

## 2026-07-16 — The Values-page timer ticks (Foundation Timer + Task under GTK's loop) (framework work; demo untouched)

*"the timer isn't updating on the values page."* Right — it sat at "Timer: 0s". This one
was deep: **two independent Linux/Swift-concurrency failures stacked on top of each other**,
each of which had to be found by tracing, not guessing.

The demo does, once per second:
```swift
Timer.scheduledTimer(withTimeInterval: 1.0, repeats: true) { _ in
    Task { @MainActor in timerTicks += 1; timerTickLabel.stringValue = "Timer: \(timerTicks)s" }
}
```

### Failure 1 — the Timer never fires

Foundation's `Timer` schedules on `RunLoop.main`. Nothing pumps that run loop under GTK's
`g_main_loop_run`. Worse, **swift-corelibs-foundation's `RunLoop` is broken for repeating
timers on 6.0.3/aarch64** — proven with a 12-line standalone: a bare
`RunLoop.main.run()` with a repeating `Timer` fires **exactly once**, then blocks forever;
looping `run(mode:before:)` with a future window blocks on the first call; with a past
window it never fires the timer. So RunLoop is unusable, and inverting the loops (run
RunLoop as the driver, pump GTK from it) fails for the same reason.

Fix: a **`Timer` type shadow** (like the existing `NotificationCenter` shadow — an extension
overload loses to Foundation's primary declaration, the documented divergence). The demo
uses only `scheduledTimer(withTimeInterval:repeats:block:)`, which routes to a backend seam
that schedules on GTK's own loop via `g_timeout_add`. Now the block fires each second.

### Failure 2 — the block fires, but `Task { @MainActor }` never runs

With the timer firing, the label still didn't move: the block's `Task { @MainActor in … }`
was enqueued and never executed. On Linux those main-actor jobs land on **libdispatch's
main queue**, which nothing drains under `g_main_loop_run`.

The documented override points — `swift_task_enqueueMainExecutor_hook` /
`swift_task_enqueueGlobal_hook` — turned out **not to be consulted** for this path on
6.0.3 (verified: a self-created `Task { @MainActor }` didn't hit either hook even after the
real runtime globals were written via `dlsym`; `@_silgen_name` alone silently bound a
*separate* symbol). What actually works is what CFRunLoop does on Apple's platforms: call
libdispatch's `_dispatch_main_queue_callback_4CF` to drain the main queue. There's no run
loop here, so a short GTK tick (~60 Hz) calls it. The symbol is SPI, resolved by `dlsym`;
if a toolchain ever drops it the timer just stops (nothing else breaks), and the install
log says so.

### Result

Driven under Xvfb: the label steps 0→1→2→… (2s at the 3s mark, 6s at 7s), and the page
stays responsive (clicking a star still works) — the drain is cheap when the queue is empty
and doesn't block GTK. Contract test pins the backend timer seam (schedule reaches the
loop; each tick runs the block). Geometry audit still **0 violations on all 11 pages**; all
contract tests pass.

**Why two hooks and a shadow instead of "just pump the run loop":** every simpler option was
tried and demonstrably fails on this toolchain — RunLoop pumping (fires once), loop
inversion (blocks), the enqueue hooks (not consulted). The write-up records the dead ends so
the next person doesn't re-walk them.

**MUST FIX (none for WinChocolate):** WinChocolate's demo branch is the synchronous
`#if canImport(WinChocolate)` path (no Task), so this is Linux-specific. The two mechanisms
live in `Compat/GLibMainActorExecutor.swift` (dispatch-queue drain) and the `Timer` shadow +
backend `scheduleTimer` seam.

## 2026-07-16 — Values page: color well, and the clock/calendar gains time editing (framework work; demo untouched)

Three things from a side-by-side macOS vs Linux screenshot.

### The "purple vs red" colour well — not a bug

`demoColors` is `[.red, .green, .blue, .white]` and `colorIndex` starts at 0, so the well
starts **red**. LinChocolate showed red — *correct*. The macOS window's purple was leftover
interaction state (its timer showed ~13.8h uptime and its status line said the date picker
had been clicked; the well cycles/opens a panel on use). No colour-value difference.

### The colour well — prettier, consistent margin

The swatch was a **narrow vertical strip** with wide side gaps: `GtkButton`'s default padding
is asymmetric (`5px 10px`), so a 32×28 well squeezed the colour to ~12×18. Now symmetric
`3px` padding with a soft `7px`-radius border and rounded inner swatch — the colour fills
the well with an even margin on all sides, the inset-pill look AppKit has. Pure CSS.

### The clock/calendar had no way to view or edit the time — fixed

`.clockAndCalendar` rendered a bare `GtkCalendar`: you could pick a **day** but there was no
clock, so the time was invisible and unchangeable (AppKit draws an editable analog clock
beside the calendar). Per the brief — *"it does not have to be an editable analog clock like
apple … but the edit time functionality needs to be there"* — the graphical picker is now a
calendar **plus a compact time field with a stepper** below it, reusing the exact
type-to-edit/stepper machinery built for `.textFieldAndStepper`. So the time can be **typed
or stepped**, per element (hour/minute/second/AM-PM).

Mechanics: the entry+stepper row was factored into `makeDateEntryRow` and is shared by both
styles. In clockAndCalendar mode the framework renders a **time-only** pattern into that
field (the calendar owns the date), and a calendar day-pick **merges** the new Y/M/D with
the current time of day — so changing the day does **not** reset the time to midnight. Our
own `select_day` calls are suppressed so they don't re-report as user edits (the same
GTK-echo trap the date field and scroller hit).

**Verified by driving it:** typed the minute to 45 and stepped the hour, then clicked
calendar day 19 — the field kept **9:45 PM** and the label read
"Tuesday, 19 May 2026 at 10:00:00 PM" with the day moved and the time preserved; dark mode
renders the field and stepper correctly. Contract tests pin it deterministically: the field
shows the time (not the date), `stringValue` stays full date+time, stepping/typing edit the
time, and a day-change preserves the set time (type 45 → pick the 19th → still 9:45 PM).
Geometry audit: **0 violations on all 11 pages**; all contract tests pass.

**MUST FIX (WinChocolate):** if its `.clockAndCalendar` lacks a time editor, add one (a
compact time field is sufficient); check the colour well's swatch margin.
## 2026-07-16 — DIRECTIVE: strip every non-import `#if` from the demo apps

**Rule One (set in stone): an AppKit-compatibility library. The ONLY conditional
a shared demo may use is the framework-import switch** — `import LinChocolate` /
`import WinChocolate` / `import AppKit`. Everything else runs once, unconditionally,
and means the same on every target. Demo-local convenience functions are allowed
(e.g. a closure `onAction` mapping to real `target`/`action`), and *they* may carry
the AppKit-vs-Chocolate switch internally, **but they must be genuinely
AppKit-compatible** (the AppKit branch is real `@objc`/`#selector` target/action) —
those files are the sanctioned home for ObjC-interop-divergent code
(`@objc`/`#selector`/`@IBOutlet`/`@IBAction`, none of which the Windows Swift
toolchain can compile).

**Bobby's call (2026-07-16): "other than the import switches they all have to go."**
`DemoApplication/main.swift` predates the rule and had **9 non-import `#if` blocks**
(the import block at lines 19–25 is the one allowed). They are being removed now:
each is either absorbed by a framework change so the line goes unconditional, moved
into a conveniences file (ObjC-interop divergence), deleted (WinChocolate-only, no
AppKit form), or noted as a LinChocolate-side fix. WinChocolate is driven to build
against the resulting import-only demo; LinChocolate fixes are listed, not made.

### Resolution + status (WinChocolate side) — **DONE 2026-07-16**

`DemoApplication/main.swift` now carries **only** the framework-import `#if` (lines
19–25). Build green, contract suite green, and live-probe-verified on Windows:
nib page instantiates, table header-click sort survives repeated clicks (no crash,
re-sorts), values/form page renders, the `Timer: Ns` label ticks 1→5→8.

| # | Approach | Status |
|---|---|---|
| A1 | Framework: `NSForm.cellSize`/`setBezeled`/`setBordered` on WinChocolate (map onto row height + composed-field bezel/border) → line unconditional | ✅ built |
| A2 | Nib `@IBOutlet`/`@IBAction` path moved to `Demo/DemoApplication/DemoNibConveniences.swift` (sanctioned `#if`, same basis as the action trampolines: `@IBOutlet`/`@IBAction`/`@objc` can't compile off Apple). `main.swift` calls `installDemoNibPanel()` import-only | ✅ live-verified |
| A3 | Framework: Win32 header-click/column-click dispatch now defers the control action via `dispatchAsync` (runs after the native notification), so the demo's plain `reloadData()` + reselect is reentrancy-safe | ✅ live-verified |
| A4 | No framework change: block uses `MainActor.assumeIsolated { … }` (the timer fires on the main thread on every target, so it updates synchronously). NB: `Task { @MainActor in }` does **not** work on Windows — the Win32 loop doesn't pump Swift's main-actor executor, so the label froze; `assumeIsolated` is the correct unified form | ✅ live-verified (ticks) |
| A5 | Framework: `NSView.viewDidChangeEffectiveAppearance()` added (`@MainActor`, matches AppKit) + fanned over the window subtree on a theme switch; demo's `DemoContentView` overrides it (drops the win-only notification observer) | ✅ built (fires on live theme switch) |
| B1 | Deleted from demo; LinChocolate must absorb it (below) | ✅ removed |
| C1/C2/C3 | Deleted from demo (WinChocolate-only: `--classic`, metallic-toolbar toggle, `--diagnose`); `--diagnose` self-check also dropped from `buildandrun.bat` | ✅ removed |

### Suggested LinChocolate fixes (not made here — flagged per the no-fix-LinChocolate rule)

The demo is now import-only, so LinChocolate must absorb the same differences the
WinChocolate framework did. Mirror these on the LinChocolate side:

- **B1 — backend + origin (was the LinChocolate `#if`).** `NSApplication.shared`
  must install the GTK backend itself (WinChocolate/AppKit do it implicitly); the
  demo no longer sets `app.nativeBackend = GTKNativeControlBackend()`. And it no
  longer sets `NSView.defaultIsFlipped = true` — the demo's content views subclass
  `isFlipped == true`, but verify any non-subclassed view still lands top-left on
  GTK, else default LinChocolate's origin to top-left.
- **A1 — `NSForm`.** Add `cellSize` / `setBezeled(_:)` / `setBordered(_:)` to
  LinChocolate's `NSForm` (the demo now calls them unconditionally).
- **A2 — nib.** `DemoNibConveniences.swift`'s Chocolate branch uses
  `NSNib(nibData:)` + `winInstantiate(withOwner:)` + `instance.view(withIdentifier:)`
  / `.connections` / `.objectsByID`. LinChocolate must expose the same surface.
- **A3 — table sort reentrancy.** LinChocolate's header/column-click dispatch must
  likewise defer the control action past the native notification (or be
  reentrancy-safe), since the demo now calls `reloadData()` directly in the action.
- **A4 — timer isolation.** LinChocolate's `Timer.scheduledTimer` block must fire on
  the main thread (as Foundation does) so `MainActor.assumeIsolated` holds.
- **A5 — appearance hook.** Add `NSView.viewDidChangeEffectiveAppearance()` and call
  it on the view subtree when the system theme changes, so the demo's override fires.

### A — framework API gaps: close these and the demo line becomes unconditional

| # | main.swift | What the `#if` does | Compliance path |
|---|---|---|---|
| A1 | **2485–2489** (`!WinChocolate && !LinChocolate`, i.e. AppKit-only) | `form.cellSize` / `setBezeled(false)` / `setBordered(true)` on the deprecated `NSForm` — skipped on the chocolates | Give `WinChocolate`/`LinChocolate` `NSForm.cellSize`/`setBezeled`/`setBordered` with matching semantics, then the demo calls them everywhere with no `#if`. (An `NSForm`-as-real-`NSMatrix` parity item.) |
| A2 | **2819–2958** (Chocolate vs AppKit) | The xib/nib path. AppKit uses real `@IBOutlet`/`@IBAction` auto-binding via `DemoNibPanelController`; the chocolates use a `DemoNibOwner` stand-in and read outlets manually | **The one sanctioned temporary exception** — add `@IBOutlet`/`@IBAction` macros to WinChocolate/LinChocolate (leave the AppKit binding as the canonical side). When they exist, delete the `#if` and keep only the AppKit path. |
| A3 | **3611–3625** (Chocolate vs AppKit) | Table sort-descriptor reload deferred through `NSApp.nativeBackend.dispatchAsync` on the chocolates (classic-backend header-click reentrancy); direct `table.reloadData()` on AppKit | Make the chocolate backends reentrancy-safe so `reloadData()` from the sort callback is fine unconditionally — the demo must not reference `NSApp.nativeBackend`. |
| A4 | **3772–3780** (`WinChocolate` vs else) | Timer tick: WinChocolate updates synchronously; AppKit wraps in `Task { @MainActor in }` because Foundation's `Timer` block is nonisolated | Align `WinFoundation.Timer`'s block isolation with Foundation's (nonisolated), then the demo uses the `Task { @MainActor in }` form on both — no `#if`. (Directly touches the new `WinFoundation.Timer`.) |
| A5 | **4790–4798** (Chocolate-only) | Observes `NSApplication.winEffectiveAppearanceDidChangeNotification` and calls `applyLiveAppearanceRefresh()`; AppKit re-themes automatically | Expose an AppKit-compatible appearance-change hook (e.g. `viewDidChangeEffectiveAppearance`, or KVO on `effectiveAppearance`) that fires on both, or have the chocolates re-theme internally so the demo needs no observer. |

### B — LinChocolate setup the framework should absorb

| # | main.swift | What the `#if` does | Compliance path |
|---|---|---|---|
| B1 | **38–46** (`LinChocolate`) | `app.nativeBackend = GTKNativeControlBackend()` and `NSView.defaultIsFlipped = true` | LinChocolate should install its GTK backend itself on `NSApplication.shared` (WinChocolate/AppKit do it implicitly), and the demo should get top-left coordinates from a flipped content-view subclass rather than the global default — removing the block. (LinChocolate-side; not edited from here.) |

### C — WinChocolate-only features/diagnostics with **no AppKit equivalent**

These aren't AppKit-compatibility surface — the API literally doesn't exist on
AppKit — so "make it unconditional" isn't possible. The compliant move is to take
them **out of the shared demo** (into a WinChocolate-only harness/among the build
scripts), or accept them as non-demo diagnostics:

| # | main.swift | What the `#if` does |
|---|---|---|
| C1 | **27–35** (`WinChocolate`) | `--classic` → `WinPresentation.selected = .classic` (ComCtl32 classic vs modern; AppKit has no such toggle) |
| C2 | **4290–4299** (Chocolate-only) | "Use Metallic Toolbar" menu item toggling `demoToolbar.winAppleLook` (a `win*` API; AppKit's toolbar already *is* Apple's) |
| C3 | **4895–4917** (Chocolate-only) | `--diagnose` build probe of the native peer plumbing (`nativeHandle`/`nativeBackend`) — a build-script seam, not AppKit surface |

**Summary:** A1–A5 close by framework API work (A2 is the pre-blessed
`@IBOutlet`/`@IBAction` one; A4 folds into the just-landed `WinFoundation.Timer`).
B1 is LinChocolate's own. C1–C3 should move out of the shared source, since they
demo WinChocolate-specific behavior rather than prove AppKit compatibility.

## 2026-07-16 — Values page: the scroller, the star rating (and the calendar overflow) (framework work; demo untouched)

Two controls Bobby named — *"the scroller above the date (or not in LinChocolate) and the
star rating"* — plus a third bug found on the way and the calendar overflow that had been
sitting in *Still open*.

### `NSScroller` — a standalone scroller wasn't a scrollbar at all

`NSScroller(frame:)` called `super.init(frame:)`, so it took **`NSView`'s** initializer and
became an empty container: there was **no `createScroller` in the backend**. It rendered as
nothing — hence "or not in LinChocolate". It now creates a real `GtkScrollbar`.

- **AppKit's NSScroller starts *disabled***, alone among controls — probed from real AppKit:
  `isEnabled == false`, `usableParts == .noScrollerParts` (0), flipping to `.allScrollerParts`
  (2) once enabled. The demo's own comment says so; LinChocolate defaulted it enabled. Now
  `false`, assigned after `super.init` so `NSControl`'s observer fires and the native side
  agrees.
- **Value mapping.** AppKit's `doubleValue` and `knobProportion` are both `0...1`. A
  `GtkAdjustment` instead runs its value over `[lower, upper - page_size]`, so with
  `upper = 1` and `page_size = knobProportion` the knob length *is* the proportion and the
  value spans `[0, 1 - proportion]`.
- **Setting the value in code no longer sends the action.** It used to fire `onAction` from
  the `doubleValue` setter, reporting positions the user never scrolled to. AppKit sends the
  action only for the user's drag.

**Verified by dragging it:** the knob moves and the demo's label reads **73**.

### `NSLevelIndicator` — `.rating`, `isEditable`, `warningValue`, `criticalValue`

All four were **accepted-and-ignored no-op stubs** in `DemoCompat` (`get { .continuousCapacity } set {}`),
so `.rating` was silently discarded and the control rendered as a capacity bar. The demo sets
every one of them. All are now real properties with a backend seam, and
`minValue`/`maxValue` push through too (they were plain stored properties, so the demo's
`maxValue = 5` — the star count — never reached the backend).

- **Style raw values are Apple's**, probed: relevancy 0, continuousCapacity 1,
  discreteCapacity 2, rating 3.
- **The stars are drawn with Cairo, not taken from the icon theme.** The first attempt used
  `starred-symbolic`/`non-starred-symbolic` and rendered **broken-image placeholders**: those
  icons are not in this container's Adwaita at all (720 icons, no star). A rating control
  shouldn't change shape with the user's icon theme — AppKit draws its own, so we do too.
- **An editable *capacity* bar takes clicks as well**, not just a rating — the demo sets
  `levelIndicator.isEditable = true` on the Level row and gives it an action. First cut wired
  the gesture only in the rating branch and computed a star index; the click maths now differ
  per style (a rating snaps to the star, a bar takes the level at the point clicked).
- **`warningValue`/`criticalValue` tint the fill** amber then red, as AppKit does.

**Verified by clicking:** the rating shows 5 stars / 3 filled (the demo's values), clicking
the 5th fills all five and the 2nd drops to two; the Level bar goes blue → **amber past 70** →
**red past 90** → back to blue, and dark mode renders the stars light-on-dark.

### The calendar overflow — closed

`GtkCalendar`'s intrinsic minimum (291×198) exceeded the frame AppKit fits a month grid into
(276×168, deliberate — see the demo's comment). The frame is law, so the *widget* had to be
made to fit rather than left to draw past its allocation over the controls below. CSS trims
the calendar's font and its header/grid padding; its last week row is now inside its border
and `Rating:` sits clear of it. This had been the top *Still open* item.

**A trap that cost two wrong click-tests:** the Values page's demo→screen Y offset is
**+226**, not the +238 I'd been estimating (the pages sit at y=144 inside the content view,
under a ~82px menubar+toolbar). Two "the click did nothing" results were my coordinates
missing the control by a few pixels, not the code failing. The stepper's zoomed measurement
is the reliable reference.

Geometry audit: **0 violations on all 11 pages**, 0 dropped children; all contract tests pass,
including new ones pinning the scroller (kind, disabled-by-default, geometry, code-set sends
no action, drag does) and the level indicator (Apple's style raw values, thresholds,
editability, rating clicks).

**MUST FIX (WinChocolate):** `NSScroller`'s disabled-by-default and no-action-on-code-set;
`NSLevelIndicator`'s `.rating`/`isEditable`/`warningValue`/`criticalValue` if they are stubs
there too.

---

## 2026-07-16 — NEW APP: RunLoopDemo (a second shared demo), single-source, imports-only

A new, **separate** app — one file, `Demo/RunLoopDemo/main.swift` — exercises the
run loop and its timers, the interactive proof for the RunLoop work
(`Docs/RunLoopDesign.md`). The **frozen demo is untouched.**

**Rule One (set in stone): the only conditional is the framework-import switch.**
`main.swift`'s single `#if` picks the world — `import WinChocolate` (which
re-exports WinFoundation) on Windows, `import AppKit` (which re-exports
Foundation) on macOS — and **every other line runs unconditionally**. This forced
the demo's shape: a hand-rolled custom action needs `@objc`/`#selector` on real
AppKit, which the Windows Swift toolchain can't compile — i.e. a *second*
conditional, which the rule forbids. So the demo **has no buttons/custom
target/action**; it drives itself from the repeating `Timer`'s block (a plain
Swift closure, no `@objc`): the tick label rises each second, at tick 2 it
enqueues a `RunLoop.main.perform` block, and at tick 4 it enters a nested
`RunLoop.main.run(mode:before:)` for 2s. `Quit` uses the framework's own
`terminate:` (a string selector that resolves on both), needing no conditional.

Two consequences worth noting:

- **Two targets, not three.** The import switch is AppKit ↔ WinChocolate only;
  adding a LinChocolate branch would be a third switch, which Rule One doesn't
  sanction. So this demo is a WinChocolate/AppKit proof; wiring it on Linux is
  LinChocolate's own call (out of scope here — LinChocolate is not edited from
  this repo).
- **Import one framework per branch, not the Foundation partner too.** `import
  WinFoundation` alongside `import WinChocolate` pulls the second `Timer`
  directly into scope and makes `Timer` ambiguous; the single framework import
  (which already re-exports its Foundation) is both correct and unambiguous.

Framework fix this shook out (WinFoundation, not the demo): `RunLoop.fireTimers`
now advances a repeating timer's next fire date **before** invoking its block, as
Foundation does — otherwise a nested run *inside* a timer handler saw the stale
date and re-fired the timer immediately. With the fix the nested run reports
exactly 2 clean ticks.

- **Windows:** `buildandrun.bat runloop` builds, runs the contract tests, launches
  it. Live-verified — ticks rise 1→9; perform fires at tick 2 ("block ran on the
  next iteration"); the nested run at tick 4 returns "2 ticks fired during it".
  Pinned headlessly by `testWinFoundationRunLoopAndTimer`.
- **macOS:** `./run-mac.sh runloop` builds & runs it; `./run-mac.sh runloop --build`
  is the compile-only faithfulness gate (both scripts gained the same `runloop`
  selector as `buildandrun.bat`; default behaviour unchanged).

## 2026-07-16 — DEMO CHANGE (authorized): the date label was too narrow for AppKit's stringValue

**A rule-break, explicitly authorized** ("lets break the rules and fix the display string
that shows date and time but cuts the time off so you just see at"). Two frame numbers,
no logic.

`dateValueLabel` was 192pt wide and seeded with `"2026-06-01"` — sized for a short date.
But it displays `datePicker.stringValue`, which is AppKit's **full** date and time style
(`Sunday, May 31, 2026 at 8:00:00 PM Eastern Daylight Time`, ~55–64 chars, ~465pt). It cut
off mid-sentence at "at".

**This was a latent *demo* bug, not a Linux one** — it would clip identically on real
macOS, and always would have. It only became visible once LinChocolate's `stringValue`
stopped returning Swift's short `Date` description and started matching AppKit (see the
Date/time entry below). The demo's own expectation was simply wrong about the API.

| | was | now |
|---|---|---|
| `dateValueLabel` | `328, 382, **192**, 24` | `328, 382, **550**, 24` (328..878) |
| `timerTickLabel` | `548, 382, 160, 24` | `898, 382, 160, 24` (898..1058) |

The timer slides right, as authorized. Nothing else is on that row: the calendar column
above ends at y≈294, and the deprecated `NSForm` at x=824 is on the **Controls** page, not
Values. The page is 1120 wide, so 1058 leaves a margin.

**Sized by measuring, and the first two attempts were wrong.** 420pt looked fine on the
initial `Sunday, 31 May 2026 …` and still clipped, because the string *grows* with the
weekday, month and zone name: stepping to `Wednesday, 30 September 2026 at 8:00:00 PM
Eastern Daylight Time` lost the final "Time". 480 fixed Eastern but left long zone names
tight. Final sizing was checked three ways:

- **Real AppKit metrics** (`NSTextField.sizeToFit` in the demo's font): worst realistic
  case `Wednesday, September 30, 2026 at 12:00:00 AM Australian Central Daylight Time` =
  **498.5pt** → 550 fits with margin. Eastern's worst is 436.5pt.
- **Driven on Linux with a long zone**: `TZ=Australia/Adelaide` renders
  `Thursday, 1 October 2026 at 9:30:00 AM Australian Central Standard Time` complete.
- **Driven on Linux with Eastern**: the exact string that clipped at 420 now renders whole.

Geometry audit **0 violations on all 11 pages**; all contract tests pass.

## 2026-07-15 — Geometry audit: the frame is now law on Linux (376 violations → 0) (framework work; demo untouched)

**The question:** how can controls overlap on Linux when the demo source — the frames —
is byte-for-byte the same source AppKit lays out correctly?

**The answer: the frame was a *floor*, not law.** In AppKit a view **is** its frame; the
frame is the allocation. GTK instead *negotiates* size, and
`gtk_widget_set_size_request()` is documented as setting a **minimum** that "will not
cause a widget to be smaller than its natural size." So every control whose intrinsic
minimum exceeded its AppKit frame silently grew past it and sat on top of its neighbour.
Same frames, different contract.

### The audit

Added `LINCHOCOLATE_GEOMETRY_AUDIT=1`, which walks every mapped widget and compares its
AppKit frame against what GTK actually allocated it, alongside the widget's intrinsic
minimum. Run across all 11 pages it found **376 violations — every control on every
page**. The `min` column named the culprits outright:

| control | demo frame | GTK intrinsic min | was |
|---|---|---|---|
| `NSStepper` | 20×28 | **120×33** | spilled 86px across its value label |
| `NSDatePicker` (calendar) | 276×168 | **291×198** | overran "Rating:" |
| `NSColorWell` | 32×28 | **58×28** | pushed into "Font…" |
| `NSLevelIndicator` | 144×18 | **152×18** | 8px over |

### The fix — one place decides geometry

`CoordinateSpace.place(_:inParentOfHeight:parentIsFlipped:)` is now **the single function
that decides a child's rect**, and both placement paths (`addSubview`, `setFrame`) go
through it. Size passes through untouched *by design* — that is what makes a frame mean
the same thing on both platforms.

To make it authoritative, LinChocolate now registers its own GObject layout manager,
**`LinChocolateFixedLayout`**, on every view's child area. GtkFixed's own layout manager
allocates each child its *minimum* size; ours allocates each child **exactly its frame,
at its frame's position** — no negotiation, which is precisely AppKit's model.

**Result: 376 → 0 violations across all 11 pages.**

### Bugs the audit found that screenshots could not

- **`NSSplitView` silently dropped both its panes.** The demo uses `splitView.addSubview(pane)`
  — Apple's original API, where a split view's subviews **are** its panes — but
  LinChocolate only implemented `addArrangedSubview`, so the panes took `NSView`'s generic
  path, which looked for a child area a `GtkPaned` doesn't have, and vanished. 22 dropped
  children (2 per page) were failing as GTK criticals nobody read. `NSSplitView.addSubview`
  now routes to the pane path, and the generic path **reports** a missing child area
  instead of dropping it. The demo's green/pink panes now render for the first time.
- **`NSStepper` was the wrong widget.** AppKit's stepper is the arrows *only* (the value
  lives in a separate field — the demo gives it 20×28 plus its own label). A
  `GtkSpinButton` bundles an entry, hence the 120px minimum. It keeps the spin button
  (which owns value/range/step and emits value-changed) but hides the entry and stacks the
  arrows: the control AppKit actually draws.
- **A pop-up workaround defending a case that never existed.** `createPopUpButton` forced
  natural height with `valign = START`, commented "the demo gives the alert-style pop-up
  96px of menu room." The demo's pop-ups are 26, 28 and 26 — there is no 96px pop-up. That
  stale workaround was the *last* 30 violations. Removed; the frame rules.

### Two traps worth remembering

- **`gtk_widget_get_width()` is not the allocation.** It returns the CSS *content* box —
  allocation minus margin, border and padding — so a perfectly placed control reads short
  by exactly its padding. My first audit "found" 28 violations that were pure measurement
  error (button −22 = 2×(10+1) padding+border; entry −14 = 2×(6+1); scale −24 = 2×12).
  Use `gtk_widget_compute_bounds()` for the real rect. *A metric that indicts every single
  row is usually indicting itself.*
- Swift's `print` to a pipe is fully buffered — a killed process loses the lot. `fflush(nil)`
  (not `fflush(stdout)`: `stdout` is a `var` and trips Swift 6 concurrency checking).

**Verified:** audit reports 0/11 pages violating and 0 dropped children; Values page
screenshot confirms the stepper reduced to `− +` with its label clear, the calendar clear
of "Rating:", the colour well a proper swatch; the split view's panes visibly render; all
contract tests pass, including new ones pinning `CoordinateSpace.place` (flip, involution,
size pass-through, no clamping) and split panes as subviews.

### Follow-up: `isFlipped` is **per view** — neighbours need not agree

Bobby's callout: *"don't forget to account for the flipped transformation as it is per
view so you can't assume they will all be the same."* Correct, and the audit had been
hiding it: all 12 of the demo's `isFlipped` overrides return `true`, matching
`defaultIsFlipped`, so **the unflipped path is never exercised by RealDemo** — every
placement was a pass-through. Two real latent bugs were sitting in it:

- **Nothing re-placed children when a parent resized.** An unflipped parent's child sits at
  `parentHeight − y − height`, so resizing the parent stranded every child at a stale Y.
  `setFrame` now re-places its children (`replaceChildren`), tracked via a new
  `childrenByParent` map.
- **The flip was cached at first-`addSubview` and never refreshed**, though `isFlipped` is
  an `open var` a subclass may compute from state. `NSView.frame` now re-reads both flips
  that decide a placement — the parent's (for its own Y) and its own (for its children's) —
  and a flip change re-places every child.

`NSForm` and `NSMatrix` each hand-rolled the same "stack rows from the top edge, flip
dependent" math. Both now call **`CoordinateSpace.stackedRowY(index:rowHeight:spacing:contentHeight:containerHeight:isFlipped:)`**,
which takes the container's *own* flip. (`LayoutSolver` also branches on the flip, but it
maps the `top`/`bottom` *attributes* rather than translating a rect — genuinely a different
operation, and it already reads `container.isFlipped` per view. The Cairo draw path reads
each view's own flip too, and applies the axis transform only for unflipped views.)

Contract tests now pin the per-view rule: sibling containers that disagree, a child that
disagrees with its parent, a **dynamic** `isFlipped` that changes at runtime (proving the
value is re-read, not served from the add-time cache), the same frame landing in two
different places under the two flips, and `stackedRowY`'s ordering inverting while row 0
stays topmost. Re-audit after the change: still **0 violations on all 11 pages**, 0 dropped
children, all contract tests pass, and the `NSMatrix`/`NSForm` layouts are unchanged
on screen.

### Follow-up 2: the Date/time control had no stepper — and could not be used at all

Bobby, on reading the note above: *"You are speaking of the missing stepper in the
Date/time control?"* No — that note was about the standalone `NSStepper` on the Values page.
But the question found a **separate, worse bug**, and a cluster behind it.

The demo never sets `datePickerStyle`, so `datePicker` takes AppKit's default
**`.textFieldAndStepper`** — a field *with a stepper*. LinChocolate defaulted to that style
correctly, then rendered it as a bare read-only `GtkEntry`: **the stepper the style is
named after did not exist.** Worse, that made the control *entirely inert* — the entry was
read-only and `setDateChangeAction` only wired `day-selected`, which only the GtkCalendar
style emits. So the demo's `datePicker.onAction` (main.swift:3113) **could never fire on
Linux**, and nothing could ever change the date.

Behind it, three properties were accepted-and-ignored no-op stubs in `DemoCompat`
(`get { nil } set {}`), so the demo's own lines did nothing:

| demo line | was | now |
|---|---|---|
| `datePicker.minDate = …` | silently discarded | stored, pushed, **clamps the value** |
| `datePicker.maxDate = …` | silently discarded | stored, pushed, clamps |
| `datePicker.datePickerElements = [.yearMonthDay, .hourMinuteSecond]` | silently discarded | drives the field's format |

All three are now real properties on `NSDatePicker` with a backend seam
(`setDateRange`, `setDatePickerElements`). The compact style is built as a field plus the
stepper (arrow buttons), which steps the date, clamps to min/max as AppKit does, and fires
the change action. `setDatePickerGraphical` rebuilds the compact side properly and
re-applies both the value and the change action, which the old swap dropped.

**A caught assumption:** my first `dateFormat` read bit 1 as "show the clock". Bit 1 is
`yearMonthDayEra` — `hourMinuteSecond` is bit 3. Reading the actual `OptionSet` instead of
trusting the bit order I'd assumed turned a silent wrong-format bug into a non-event.

**Verified by driving it** (xdotool, under Xvfb): the field now shows the arrows; two
clicks up moved **2026-06-01 → 2026-06-03**, one click down → 2026-06-02, and the blue
`dateValueLabel` beside it tracked every step — that label is only written by
`datePicker.onAction`, so it proves the action that could never fire now does. The
`.clockAndCalendar` picker still renders through the rebuilt swap. Geometry re-audit: still
**0 violations on all 11 pages**; all contract tests pass, including new ones pinning the
default style, min/max clamping and element round-tripping.

**MUST FIX (both frameworks):** ~~`NSDatePickerElementFlags`' raw values are invented
(`1 << 0`, `1 << 1`, …). Apple's are `0x00e0` (yearMonthDay), `0x000e` (hourMinuteSecond),
`0x000c` (hourMinute), `0x0010` (timeZone), `0x00c0` (yearMonth) — and Apple's are
*cumulative* (`hourMinuteSecond` contains `hourMinute`), which ours are not. Symbolic use
works; a raw value or a `.contains` check across the pair would not. Same gap in
WinChocolate.~~ **Done on WinChocolate 2026-07-16** (Round 5), with tests pinning each raw
value and the cumulativity in both directions.

### Follow-up 3: one stepper, built like Apple's — two buttons stacked

Bobby: *"how is the other stepper implemented - 2 side by side buttons? If we have to
create controls i would prefer you match apple so two buttons on top of each other."*

It wasn't two buttons at all — `NSStepper` was still a **GtkSpinButton with its text entry
hidden**, so the `−` `+` were GTK's own built-in spin buttons, side by side, and the
`.vertical` class meant to stack them never took. Rebuilt from buttons:

**`makeStepperArrows(onStep:)`** — two arrow buttons stacked, up above down — is now the
single stepper implementation, shared by `NSStepper` and `NSDatePicker`'s
`.textFieldAndStepper` field. Dropping the spin button means the backend owns what it used
to provide (value, range, increment, and the change notification): `stepStepper` applies
the increment, clamps to the range and reports, exactly as AppKit's NSStepper does.

**Verified by driving it:** the stepper renders as ▲ over ▼ in its 20×28 frame with the
value label clear beside it; three clicks up moved 50 → **53**, one click down → **52**.
Geometry re-audit: **0 violations across all 11 pages**, 0 dropped children; all contract
tests pass.

**A near-miss worth recording.** The first click test read 50 → **47** on what I thought was
the up arrow, which looks exactly like an inverted direction mapping. It wasn't: zooming
the screenshot showed the control occupying screen y 320–347 with its divider at 335, so
y=338 was the *down* arrow and my follow-up click at y=352 was below the widget entirely
(hence "no change"). The mapping was right; my coordinates were wrong. **Measure the
control before concluding the code is wrong** — a plausible-looking bug report can be an
artifact of the test.

The audit also learned to tell **"not allocated yet" (0×0 bounds) from "allocated wrongly"**:
the Auto Layout page animates, so a 2s snapshot intermittently caught a widget mid-relayout
and reported it as a frame fault. It is now counted and labelled separately.

### Follow-up 4: the date field edits the selected element, and formats like AppKit

Bobby: *"it is always changing the day even when i have other segments selected. It needs
to increment the selected one. Also the date format is not correct for it or the string
that gets set because of it."* Both true. **Measured against real AppKit** rather than
guessed — a probe printed `NSDatePicker.stringValue` and rendered the control to a PNG:

| | LinChocolate was | real AppKit | now |
|---|---|---|---|
| field text | `2026-06-01 00:00:00` (ISO, UTC) | `5/31/2026, 8:00:00 PM` | matches |
| `stringValue` | `2026-06-01 00:00:00 +0000` (Swift's `Date` description) | `Sunday, May 31, 2026 at 8:00:00 PM Eastern Daylight Time` | matches |
| stepper | always ±1 **day** | edits the **selected** element | matches |

**The format.** AppKit builds the field from a locale *template*, not a style: the render
shows a 4-digit year, which `.short` (`5/31/26`) can't produce.
`DateFormatter.dateFormat(fromTemplate: "Mdyyyyjmmss", …)` → `M/d/yyyy, h:mm:ss a` →
`5/31/2026, 8:00:00 PM`, matching AppKit's pixels exactly. And `stringValue` turned out to
be plain `DateFormatter(dateStyle: .full, timeStyle: .full)` — **independent of
`datePickerElements`** (a date-only picker returns the same full string; confirmed by
probing both).

**The architecture was the real bug.** The *backend* was formatting the date, so locale,
calendar, time zone and element flags — all AppKit semantics — were being decided in GTK.
The framework now owns all of it: `NSDatePicker` renders the pattern, records each field's
character range, tracks the selected field, and steps it via
`Calendar.date(byAdding:value:to:)`. GTK is reduced to what a backend should be: show this
text, highlight this range, report a click offset and a stepper direction. Linux Foundation
produces byte-identical output to macOS's (verified), so this is correct on both.
Clicking a field selects it, the arrows step it, and ←/→ move between fields.

**Element flags corrected to Apple's actual values** (read from real AppKit):
`yearMonthDay` = **0xe0** (not `1<<0`), `hourMinuteSecond` = **0xe**, `hourMinute` = 0xc,
`timeZone` = 0x10, `yearMonth` = 0xc0, `era` = 0x100 — and they are **cumulative**
(`yearMonthDay` contains `yearMonth`), so the wider flag must be tested first. Apple has
**no `yearMonthDayEra`**; that member was invented, and is gone. `minDate`/`maxDate`
clamp for real (framework-side, since it's AppKit semantics).

**Verified by driving it** (xdotool, under Xvfb): clicking the **year** highlighted `2026`,
and two stepper clicks took it to **2028** — the year, not the day — with the demo's label
recomputing to `Wednesday, 31 May 2028`, the correct weekday in AppKit's full style. (The
container's locale renders `31/05/2026` day-first, which is the point: the format follows
the locale, as AppKit's does.) Geometry re-audit: **0 violations on all 11 pages**; all
contract tests pass.

**Two assumptions caught by checking:**
- My test literals used a plain space; ICU emits **U+202F** (narrow no-break space) before
  AM/PM — on macOS *and* Linux alike. The code was right and the test was wrong. The
  literals now spell `\\u{202F}` explicitly so an invisible character can never silently
  decide a comparison.
- A test asserted stepping the month up then down restores the date. It doesn't, and
  shouldn't: May 31 + 1 month = June **30** (the day clamps to the shorter month), and back
  = May **30**. That's Gregorian arithmetic — Calendar's and AppKit's — not a bug. The
  behaviour is now pinned by a test that says so.

**MUST FIX (WinChocolate):** ~~same invented element flags (`Sources/WinChocolate/Controls/NSDatePicker.swift:21`
has `yearMonthDay = 1 << 0`); needs Apple's cumulative raw values, `.era`/`.yearMonth`, the
locale-template field format, `stringValue` as full/full, and stepping the selected element.~~
**Done 2026-07-16** (Round 5, `Docs/AppKitFaithfulnessIssues.md`). The Windows field also
turned out to be hardcoding its time fields to zero and formatting in UTC, so it read
`6/1/2026 12:00:00 AM`; it now reads AppKit's probed `5/31/2026, 8:00:00 PM`. This needed a
`TimeZone` type and a zone-aware `DateFormatter` in WinFoundation, which was UTC-only.

### Follow-up 5: the date field is type-to-edit

Bobby: *"when you highlight a segment you should be able to type the number as well (00 to
55 with a stepper is painful) - apples version does this."* Right — stepping a minute to 55
one click at a time is unusable. The selected element now takes typed digits.

**Behaviour** (framework-side, so both backends inherit it):
- Digits accumulate into the selected field: `4` → `8:04`, then `5` → `8:45`.
- The selection **auto-advances** when the field is full, or when no further digit could be
  valid — no month starts with `4`, so `4` commits April and hops straight to the day.
- A digit that can't extend the run **starts a fresh value** rather than being dropped: on
  the day, `3` then `5` is the 5th, not "35".
- A leading zero is **held, not rejected**: `0` then `7` is July.
- The year takes four digits; `a`/`p` set AM/PM; typing fires the picker's action.
- Typing an hour on a 12-hour clock keeps the current half-day (`11` at 8 PM → 11 PM).

**Typing clamps the day like stepping does.** Typing month `4` onto May **31** produced
`5/1/2026` — Foundation *rolled* April 31 forward into May 1, while stepping clamps (May 31
+ 1 month = June 30). The two disagreed; typed month/year now clamps the day to the
month's last, so they agree and match AppKit.

**The bug the contract tests couldn't see.** Typing `4` `5` gave `8:05`, not `8:45` — yet
the in-memory test passed. Tracing the real backend showed why: GTK **batches the entry's
cursor notifications and delivers them after** `set_text`/`select_region` return, so the
field re-reports its own selection mid-typing, outside the suppression window — and
`selectSegment` was resetting the typed run on every report, swallowing the second digit.
The cursor position is a leaky proxy for "the user clicked". Fix: **only a *change* of
field abandons a run.** A regression test now reproduces the echo in-memory, so the seam
covers it.

**Verified by typing into the running app:** `4` `5` → `8:45` (selection advances to
seconds), `5` `9` → `8:45:59` (advances to PM), then month `1` `2` → December with the day
clamped to the 31st, the weekday recomputed to Thursday, and the zone correctly flipping to
**Eastern Standard** Time. Geometry audit: 0 violations on all 11 pages; all contract tests
pass.

`LINCHOCOLATE_DATE_DEBUG=1` traces the field's cursor notifications — it is what found the
batching, and this class of bug will recur.

**MUST FIX (WinChocolate):** ~~same type-to-edit surface — digits into the selected element,
auto-advance, leading-zero buffering, `a`/`p`, and day-clamping shared with stepping.~~
**Done 2026-07-16** (Round 5) — supplied by the native `SysDateTimePick32` once the style
was given its `DTS_UPDOWN` stepper, rather than reimplemented: the control has done
digits-into-the-selected-element with auto-advance since 1997, and it is the Windows look.
Live-verified: typing `1` `2` on the month gives December with the day kept at 31 and the
weekday recomputed to Sunday — the same result recorded here for Linux.

### Still open (rendering fidelity, not geometry — for the page-by-page pass)

- ~~GtkCalendar overflows its frame~~ — **fixed** 2026-07-16 (see the Values-page entry).
- ~~`NSDatePicker`'s stepper always steps the day~~ — **fixed**; it steps the selected
  element, and the field is type-to-edit.
- Vertical slider track renders thinner than AppKit's.

**Files touched** (all LinChocolate)

- `Geometry/CoordinateSpace.swift` — `place(_:inParentOfHeight:parentIsFlipped:)`
- `Native/GTK/GTKNativeControlBackend.swift` — `LinChocolateFixedLayout`, placement routed
  through `place`, strict child-area check, stepper, pop-up workaround removed, the audit
- `Views/NSView.swift` — `adoptSubview`; `addSubview` is `open`
- `Views/NSSplitView.swift` — `addSubview` adds a pane
- `Tests/LinChocolateContractTests` — geometry + split-pane tests

## 2026-07-15 — Toolbar customization is now Apple's real sheet, with drag-and-drop (framework work; demo untouched)

The tile-toggle panel from earlier today was, correctly, called out as "a prettier version
of the same bad concept." Replaced with **Apple's actual customization model**, including
the WinChocolate concession — since dragging into the real toolbar would cross native
windows, **the bar is duplicated at the top of the dialog and that strip is the
drag-and-drop surface**:

- **Strip** (top): a live duplicate of the toolbar. Drop a palette item on it to insert at
  the pointer position; drag a strip item off onto the panel body to remove it; drag
  within the strip to reorder. Edits apply to the real toolbar immediately.
- **Palette**: "Drag your favorite items into the toolbar…" — items already present are
  **dimmed** (except the multi-instance space/flexible-space/separator), exactly as on
  Apple. No click-to-toggle.
- **Default set**: "… or drag the default set into the toolbar." — one draggable unit;
  dropping it on the strip resets the toolbar to the delegate's defaults.
- **Show popup**: Icon and Text / Icon Only / Text Only — drives
  `NSToolbar.displayMode`, which the bar now honors in all three modes (previously
  ignored).
- **Done** (suggested-action blue).

**Mechanics.** The backend seam changed from a toggle callback to Apple's edit model —
`NativeToolbarCustomizationSession` (strip + palette + default set + display mode) with
`onInsert(id, index)` / `onMove(from, to)` / `onRemove(index)` / `onResetToDefault` /
`onDisplayMode` / `onClose`; the framework pushes a refreshed session to the open panel
after every edit. GTK side: real GTK4 drag-and-drop (`GtkDragSource` string payloads,
`GtkDropTarget` on the strip and the panel body, insertion index computed from the drop
x over the strip tiles). The hermetic contract tests were migrated to the new seam and
extended: insert-at-position, reorder, remove, reset, and displayMode all covered.

**Verified with a real pointer drag** (xdotool, under Xvfb): dragging the **Colors** tile
from the palette into the strip inserted it in the strip, updated the live toolbar behind
the panel, and dimmed the palette tile; after **Done**, the real toolbar keeps Colors with
its icon. All contract tests pass.

One compiler note for the file's future: the palette's drag trampolines initially reused
the names of the view-level DnD trampolines further down the file — Swift's redeclaration
check **segfaulted** (signal 11) rather than erroring. If that crash appears again, look
for duplicate top-level declarations first.

**Files touched** (all LinChocolate)

- `Native/NativeControlBackend.swift` — session/handlers types; `installToolbar` takes a
  display mode
- `Views/NSToolbar.swift` — session assembly, insert/move/remove/reset/displayMode
  callbacks, live session push
- `Native/GTK/GTKNativeControlBackend.swift` — the drag panel, GTK4 DnD plumbing,
  display-mode-aware item rendering
- `Native/InMemoryNativeControlBackend.swift`, `Tests/LinChocolateContractTests` — new
  seam + migrated/extended tests

## 2026-07-15 — Linux toolbar: Apple-style customization palette, standard items, separator (framework work; demo untouched)

The customization UI was a native GTK checkbox list leaking raw identifiers
("NSToolbarShowColorsItem"). Per the standing direction — **the toolbar is the one place
that should look more Apple and less native** — it is now an Apple-style palette in the
WinChocolate design: a grid of tiles (icon over label), a pressed tile = present in the
toolbar, live add/remove on click, Done. Styled with the same theme-relative CSS as the
toolbar strip, so it reads correctly in both appearances. The backend seam
(`runToolbarCustomization`) is unchanged, so the hermetic contract tests pass untouched.

**Standard items are synthesized (Apple's 6.6 behavior).** When the delegate returns nil
for `.showColors`/`.showFonts`/`.print`, the framework now builds them — friendly labels,
symbolic theme icons, and behaviors (Colors → color panel, Fonts → font panel). Bare
standard items the app supplies (the demo's `.separator`) get Apple's palette names via a
fallback — raw identifiers never reach the user. **The separator item now renders as a
real divider** in the bar (`.space` as a fixed gap).

**The disappearing page-selector bug.** Toggling any item rebuilt the toolbar — and the
embedded view items (page selector, search field) vanished. Cause: `gtk_widget_unparent`
during the rebuild drops the old bar's reference, which was the **only** reference, so
GTK destroyed the widgets before the new bar could re-embed them. The rebuild now holds a
reference across the move. (Same GTK lifetime trap class as `setButtonKind`'s
ref-sink/unref dance — worth remembering: *an unparented GTK4 widget with no held
reference is gone.*)

**Verified:** palette screenshots light + dark (tiles, icons, checked-state); an
end-to-end toggle session — Colors in → Fonts in → Colors out → Done — leaves the bar
with exactly the right items, icons intact, page selector and search field surviving
repeated rebuilds; contract tests all pass.

**Files touched** (all LinChocolate)

- `Views/NSToolbar.swift` — standard-item synthesis, palette names, tile art plumbing
- `Native/NativeControlBackend.swift` — palette items carry image path/template/icon name
- `Native/GTK/GTKNativeControlBackend.swift` — tile-grid palette, separator/space
  rendering, view-widget refs held across reinstall, tile CSS

## 2026-07-15 — Linux toolbar: real icons, template tinting — and the dark-mode mystery solved (framework work; demo untouched)

### Toolbar icons render on Linux

`NativeToolbarItemSpec` only carried a GTK **icon-theme name**; the demo's Tabler icons
are **file-backed** (`NSImage(contentsOfFile:)`), so Linux fell back to text-only
buttons. The spec now carries `imagePath` + `imageIsTemplate`; the GTK backend loads the
PNG via GdkPixbuf, renders it icon-above-label (the same layout as the icon-name branch —
macOS's `.iconAndLabel`), and **recolors template pixels to the theme foreground** (white
in dark, near-black in light) keeping alpha — AppKit's template semantics, one shipped
image for both appearances. `NSImage.isTemplate` became a real stored property (it was a
`get { false } set {} ` stub, silently discarding what the demo set).

**Item order is a non-bug:** Linux renders exactly the demo's `defaultIdentifiers`
(open, save, page, search, separator, flexible, toggle, customize). macOS showing
Customize third is its own autosaved user customization, not the demo's order.

**Verified:** light + dark screenshots (icons tinted correctly in both); an `xdotool`
click on **Open** launched the open panel — toolbar target/action dispatch is live.
The customization palette's logic is covered by the hermetic contract tests.

### The dark-mode "invisible labels" root cause (from last night's follow-up list)

The dark screenshots finally made it obvious: **GTK was in dark mode (white label text)
while the demo's pages painted a light background underneath** — because LinChocolate's
`NSColor.windowBackgroundColor`/`controlBackgroundColor`/`textColor`/`labelColor`/…
were **hardcoded light**. On Apple, system colors are *dynamic* — they resolve against
the current appearance at read time. They now do exactly that in LinChocolate, and dark
mode is fully legible: captions, radio/checkbox labels, both Form sections, the works.

**Files touched** (all LinChocolate)

- `Native/NativeControlBackend.swift`, `Native/GTK/GTKNativeControlBackend.swift` —
  spec + pixbuf render + template recolor (+ tracked appearance)
- `Views/NSToolbar.swift` — passes image path/template
- `Media/NSImage.swift` — real `isTemplate`
- `Compat/DemoCompat.swift` — dynamic system colors

**Follow-up:** a live in-app appearance switch re-resolves demo-painted colors but the
toolbar icons keep their launch-time tint until the toolbar reinstalls.

---

## 2026-07-15 — LinChocolate catches up to the demo: Linux builds, runs, and clicks again (framework work; demo untouched)

**Overnight framework sweep.** The rule for this entry was the inverse of every entry
above: **the demo is the spec and could not be changed** — LinChocolate had to rise to
meet it. Starting point: `RealDemo` at **441 errors** (387 + DemoConveniences.swift,
which had *never been compiled on Linux* — the RealDemo target only symlinked
main.swift). Ending point: **0 errors, all 11 pages launch under Xvfb, contract tests
pass, and a click test proves the action pipeline end-to-end.** Not one demo line changed
(the `@IBOutlet` permission was never needed — the macOS nib branch is already `#if`'d
out on Linux).

### The architecture that was missing (the bulk of the night)

LinChocolate had no `NSObject`→`NSResponder`→`NSView`→`NSControl` chain — every control
was `final class X: NSView`, there was no `target`/`action`, and the demo's conveniences
(closure sugar over *real* target/action, exactly as on Windows) had nothing to attach to:

- **`LinChocolate.NSObject`** — the selector-dispatch root (`responds(to:)` /
  `perform(_:with:)` over LinChocolate's `Selector`), shadowing Foundation's exactly as
  WinFoundation does on Windows. The demo's `DemoActionTarget` overrides now land.
- **`NSResponder`**, with `NSView` under it.
- **`NSControl: NSView`** with `target`/`action`/`isEnabled`/`isContinuous`/`sendAction()`
  — and **every control's native callback now calls `sendAction()`**, so the demo's
  trampolines fire. (This also closed the colour-well MUST FIX on Linux: its action now
  fires on colour change.) 20 control classes reparented and opened; `NSOutlineView`
  under `NSControl`; `NSImageView` **open** (the `final` MUST FIX) so
  `DemoClickableImageView` compiles.
- `NSMenuItem`/`NSToolbarItem` under `NSObject` with real `Selector` actions dispatched.
- **`NotificationCenter` shadow** — real Foundation's observer blocks are `@Sendable`
  (the long-documented divergence); the shadow takes `@MainActor` blocks, so the demo's
  appearance observer compiles unchanged.

### MUST FIXes from the entries above, now closed for LinChocolate

`NSPasteboardWriting` + `NSString` conformance, `NSPasteboardItem`,
`NSPasteboard.pasteboardItems`/`writeObjects`, `tableView(_:pasteboardWriterForRow:)
-> NSPasteboardWriting?` (+ `validateDrop`/`acceptDrop`), `NSTableView.DropOperation`,
`setDropRow(_:dropOperation:)`, `setDraggingSourceOperationMask` (table + outline),
`NSBrowser.columnResizingType`/`minColumnWidth` (Apple's defaults), `NSImageView` open,
`NSAppearance.bestMatch(from:)`/`currentDrawing()`, `NSBitmapImageRep`
(`colorAt`/`pixelsWide/High`/`representation(using: .bmp)`/`init(data:)`) +
`CGDataProvider` + Apple's `CGImage` designated init (all backed by the existing BMP
codec), `NSUserInterfaceItemIdentifier` on `NSTableColumn`, `NSTextField.backgroundColor`
(and clip/row-view/path-control), delegate protocols with Apple signatures
(`Notification`, `tableView(_:rowViewForRow:)`, `@MainActor` table delegate),
`NSFontDescriptor`/`symbolicTraits`/`NSFontChanging`, `NSForm.cell(at:)` +
`NSFormCell.titleWidth`, `NSButtonCell(textCell:)`, `NSViewController()`,
`NSRect.fill()/frame()`, `NSView.isDescendant(of:)`, `NSView()`, Apple's
`NSButton`/`NSSegmentedControl` content conveniences, `CFData` (typealias — corelibs
doesn't surface it, and the demo's `Data as CFData` must compile).

### The bug worth remembering: observers don't fire in initializers

After the build reached zero, every **plain push button rendered blank** — model-level
contract tests passed, the GTK title path worked in isolation, and a backend trace
finally showed `createButton("")` ×109 with **zero** `setText` calls for buttons. Cause:
the demo's `convenience init(title:frame:)` (an *extension on the class itself*) does
`self.init(frame:)` then `self.title = title` — and **Swift suppresses property
observers for assignments inside any initializer of the type, including app-side
extension convenience inits.** `NSButton.title`/`NSBox.title` were the only two
stored-with-didSet properties among everything the demo's conveniences assign (all the
rest were already computed-over-backing, which is why only buttons broke). Both are now
computed over backing storage — a setter always runs. **Framework rule adopted: any
property whose setter must reach the native side must be computed, never
stored-with-didSet.**

### Verified

- Build: **441 → 0** across ~10 census-driven iterations; framework target and contract
  tests green throughout; `RealDemo` links (8 MB) and the hermetic contract suite passes
  (+2 new cases pinning the post-init title path).
- Runtime, under Xvfb (`GSK_RENDERER=cairo`): **all 11 pages launch and render**; the
  CoreGraphics page draws every canvas **including the BMP-round-tripped heart through
  the new `NSBitmapImageRep`**; the Nib page instantiates the xib (11 objects, 2 actions,
  5 outlets); an `xdotool` click on **Click** incremented the counter to 2 with "button
  fired" in the status — the full GTK → backend → `sendAction` → handler chain, live.
- Page screenshots: `LinChocolate/.artifacts-pages/page0..10.png`.

### Follow-ups (Linux runtime, not build)

- **Dark-mode label contrast**: radio/checkbox labels and captions are nearly invisible
  in `--dark` (fine in `--light`); framework CSS is theme-safe, so the culprit is still
  open — first suspect is the demo-painted dark backgrounds against GTK's dark label
  colors.
- `NSImage.draw(in:)` is still a no-op stub (`DemoCompat`), so `NSImage(data:)` sprites
  and page artwork don't render.
- `scrollRowToVisible` remains a stub (both frameworks — MUST FIX above still open).
- Field hierarchy: `NSSecureTextField`/`NSSearchField`/`NSTokenField`/`NSComboBox`
  should sit under `NSTextField` as on Apple; tonight they carry their own
  `backgroundColor`/`onTextChanged` shims inside the framework.
- WinChocolate's side of every MUST FIX is untouched (not buildable here).

## 2026-07-14 — Toolbar icons: real artwork (Tabler Icons) instead of hand-drawn pixels

The toolbar art was **generated at runtime** by `demoToolbarBitmapPath(named:width:kind:)`
— 172 lines that plotted pixels one at a time to spell OPEN / SAVE / CUSTOMIZE / DISABLE
into little boxes. That is why it looked the way it did.

Replaced with four [Tabler Icons](https://tabler.io/icons) (MIT, © Paweł Kuna), chosen to
match each item's actual verb:

| Item | Tabler icon |
|---|---|
| Open | `outline/folder-open.svg` |
| Save | `outline/device-floppy.svg` |
| Disable Save | `outline/ban.svg` |
| Customize | `outline/adjustments-horizontal.svg` |

Credits and the re-render recipe: `Demo/DemoApplication/Resources/ICON_CREDITS.md`.

**Rendered black-on-transparent and marked `isTemplate = true`,** so each framework tints
them for the current appearance — the demo ships **one** copy, not a light and a dark one.
(Tabler strokes in `currentColor`; with no CSS context that renders black — verified rather
than assumed. macOS reads SVG natively via `_NSSVGImageRep`, which is what rasterised them.)

**64px artwork in a 32pt item** is exactly 1:1 on Retina, so no `NSImage.size` assignment is
needed — which matters, because **LinChocolate's `NSImage` has no `size` property at all**.
The items' `minSize`/`maxSize` moved from the old text-box shapes (58×34, 96×34, 86×34) to
a square **32×32**.

**Also removed 172 lines of now-dead generator.**

**Files touched**

- `Demo/DemoApplication/Resources/` — 4 new PNGs + `ICON_CREDITS.md`
- `Demo/DemoApplication/main.swift` — load the PNGs; `isTemplate = true`; square items;
  generator deleted

**Verified**

- macOS: built and ran. The toolbar shows the four icons, **tinted white for dark mode by
  the template path** — no light/dark variants shipped.
- Linux: `RealDemo` **387 → 387** — no cost.

**Follow-up (already on the MUST FIX list):** LinChocolate's `NSImage.draw(in:)` is a
**no-op stub** in `DemoCompat.swift` and its `isTemplate` is a stub too
(`get { false } set {} `), so these icons will not render there until real image drawing
lands — regardless of format. WinChocolate has both for real.

## 2026-07-14 — Nib page: now renders on macOS, using Apple's automatic `@IBOutlet` binding

The page showed a placeholder: *"excluded from the macOS cross-check until automatic
@IBOutlet binding lands (12.1 KVC layer)."* The reasoning was inverted — **automatic
`@IBOutlet` binding is exactly what macOS already has.** It is the *chocolate frameworks*
that lack it and need the manual `winInstantiate` + connection-record model as a stand-in.
The page was excluded from the one target that could do it natively.

**Both halves are now real, and the page renders on all three:**

| | How the xib's connections resolve |
|---|---|
| **macOS** | Apple's automatic binding — `@IBOutlet`/`@IBAction` + the ObjC runtime, resolved during `instantiate(withOwner:topLevelObjects:)`. **No identifier lookup, no connection records.** |
| **Windows / Linux** | the same xib parsed at runtime, connection records read back explicitly (the 15.4 wiring model) |

The seam is **`@objc`, not a gap being papered over**: `@IBOutlet`/`@IBAction` do not exist
off-Darwin, which is the identical language-level seam `DemoConveniences` already documents
for `@objc` action selectors. Each target uses its own genuine mechanism and the page
behaves identically.

**One real build step, not a workaround.** A `.xib` is Interface Builder *source*; AppKit's
`NSNib` loads the *compiled* `.nib` — which is what Xcode's build phase produces for every
Mac app. `run-mac.sh` now runs `ibtool` over the xib into the app bundle. WinChocolate and
LinChocolate have no ibtool and parse the xib XML directly, so each target consumes the one
shipped `.xib` the way its own toolchain does.

**Verified before writing any demo code** — a standalone harness proved Apple resolves the
whole document:

```
instantiate -> true, topLevelObjects = 2      top-level NSView: 480×240
Outlets wired AUTOMATICALLY:  nameField ✓  check ✓  slider ✓  popup ✓  countLabel ✓
Action from the xib: increment: → target=DemoNibPanelController → countLabel = "1"
```

The demo's File's Owner is now `DemoNibPanelController` — the exact `customClass` the xib
names — declaring the five `@IBOutlet`s and two `@IBAction`s the xib connects. It declares
them; AppKit does the rest.

**Files touched**

- `Demo/DemoApplication/main.swift` — macOS branch added (`DemoNibPanelController` +
  `NSNib.instantiate(withOwner:topLevelObjects:)`); the placeholder is gone; the intro and
  status labels moved out of the fence and are shared
- `run-mac.sh` — compiles `DemoNibPanel.xib` → `.nib` with `ibtool`

**Verified**

- macOS: built and ran. The panel renders from the xib — title, text field, Increment
  button + count, checkbox, Show Outlet Values, slider, popup, box — and the page reports
  *"Instantiated 2 top-level object(s); **5/5 outlets and 2 actions (increment:,
  showValues:) bound automatically by AppKit** from the xib's connections."*
- Linux: `RealDemo` **387 → 387** — no cost; the Windows/Linux branch is untouched.

**Note on the two exclusions.** Both fences examined today dissolved on contact:
CoreGraphics' was unnecessary (Apple *does* have a BMP codec — `NSBitmapImageRep`), and
this one was backwards (Apple *has* the binding the fence was waiting for). Neither was
load-bearing. That is worth remembering the next time an exclusion is written: the
comment explaining why something can't work is itself a claim, and it should be measured
like any other.

---

## 2026-07-14 — CoreGraphics page: whole page was fenced out of macOS over one sprite

**The page showed a placeholder on macOS**: *"The WinCoreGraphics page is excluded from the
macOS cross-check until Phase 13 presents an Apple-shaped CGImage."* The exclusion was real
but **far too wide** — it hid the entire page over the one part that genuinely diverges.

**Measured** by simply un-fencing it: **only the BMP-codec sprite failed.** Everything else
on the artboard — `CGMutablePath`, `CGGradient`, `CGContext` save/translate/rotate
transforms — is plain CoreGraphics that AppKit runs happily. The fence now covers only
what actually diverges, and macOS renders three of the four canvases.

**Two genuine demo bugs were hiding behind the fence**, neither of which was the CGImage
surface:

**1. `NSColor` passed where CoreGraphics wants `CGColor`.** Apple's `CGContext.setFillColor`
/ `setStrokeColor` take `CGColor`. Both chocolate frameworks do
`typealias CGColor = NSColor` (in their `CGCompat.swift`), so `setFillColor(someNSColor)`
compiles there and is a type error on Apple. Both frameworks *also* vend `.cgColor` on
`NSColor`, so `.cgColor` is the one spelling correct on all three — 5 call sites fixed.

**2. `CGGradient` was silently returning nil.** This one is the interesting failure:

```swift
CGGradient(colorsSpace: …, colors: [NSColor(…), NSColor(…)] as CFArray, locations: [0, 1])
```

`NSColor` is **not** toll-free bridged to `CGColor`, so the initializer could not interpret
the array and returned **nil** — and `if let ramp = …` then quietly drew nothing. The label
"Linear + radial gradients" rendered above an empty space. It compiled, ran, logged
nothing, and simply omitted two of the four canvases. Fixed by passing `.cgColor`.

### Then the fence went away entirely — the BMP round-trip is plain Apple API

The remaining exclusion turned out to be unnecessary too. **Apple can do the whole
round-trip**; the demo was simply written against WinCoreGraphics' bespoke spelling of it:

| What the demo needed | WinCoreGraphics' spelling | **Apple's** |
|---|---|---|
| build a `CGImage` from raw RGBA | `CGImage(width:height:rgbaPixels:)` | `CGDataProvider` + `CGImage`'s designated init |
| encode to BMP | `CGImage.encodeBMP()` | `NSBitmapImageRep.representation(using: .bmp,…)` |
| decode BMP | `CGImage.decodeBMP(_:)` | `NSBitmapImageRep(data:)` |
| read a pixel | `CGImage.pixel(atX:y:)` | `NSBitmapImageRep.colorAt(x:y:)` |

`NSBitmapImageRep` **is** Apple's BMP codec — the capability was never missing, only the
API shape. Verified independently before rewriting: raw RGBA → `CGImage` → `.bmp` (394
bytes, `BM` header) → decode → `colorAt(2,2)` returns exactly `r214 g60 b80`, and the
transparent corner reads alpha 0. The round-trip is real, not simulated.

**Result: the artboard has no conditional compilation at all** — all five canvases (CGPath
leaf, linear ramp in a rounded clip, radial glow, transform rosette, BMP-round-tripped
sprite read back pixel-by-pixel, and the `NSImage(data:)` sprite) render on macOS from the
same source. The 18.10 exclusion is gone rather than narrowed, and the page's captions no
longer claim a WinCoreGraphics-specific codec.

### 🛠 MUST FIX — WinChocolate and LinChocolate

**`CGImage` must be Apple's, and `NSBitmapImageRep` must exist.** Both frameworks ship a
bespoke class with *none* of Apple's surface:

| API | Apple | WinChocolate | LinChocolate |
|---|---|---|---|
| `CGImage.init(width:height:bitsPerComponent:bitsPerPixel:bytesPerRow:space:bitmapInfo:provider:decode:shouldInterpolate:intent:)` | ✓ | **absent** | **absent** |
| `CGDataProvider` | ✓ | **absent** | **absent** |
| `NSBitmapImageRep` (`representation(using:)`, `init(data:)`, `colorAt(x:y:)`, `pixelsWide/High`) | ✓ | **absent** | **absent** |
| `CGImage(width:height:rgbaPixels:)` | — | ✓ *(invented)* | ✓ *(invented)* |
| `CGImage.encodeBMP()` / `.decodeBMP(_:)` / `.pixel(atX:y:)` | — | ✓ *(invented)* | ✓ *(invented)* |

This is Issue L / Phase 13, and the shape of the fix is now concrete: the BMP codec belongs
on `NSBitmapImageRep` where Apple puts it, not bolted onto `CGImage`; pixel access belongs
on the rep, not the image; and construction goes through `CGDataProvider`. The invented
members should retire with it — every one of them is a place a caller writes something that
cannot compile on Apple.

**A mistake worth recording.** My first attempt opened the sprite fence *before* the static
and closed it *after* `dataBackedSprite` at the bottom of the class — **swallowing
`draw(_:)`**. On macOS the view then had no `draw` at all: it compiled cleanly, rendered
nothing, and looked exactly like the bug I was fixing. That is the same "compiles, runs,
does nothing" trap this document keeps cataloguing, and a conditional-compilation fence is
an easy way to create one by hand. Fences want to be as small as the divergence — a wide
one silently takes working code with it.

**Files touched**

- `Demo/DemoApplication/main.swift` — **every fence in `DemoCoreGraphicsView` removed
  (now 0)**; sprite rebuilt on `CGDataProvider` + `CGImage`'s designated init +
  `NSBitmapImageRep`; pixel loop reads `colorAt(x:y:)`; 5 `setFillColor`/`setStrokeColor`
  and 2 `CGGradient` call sites pass `.cgColor`; the macOS placeholder and the
  WinCoreGraphics-specific captions are gone

**Verified**

- macOS: built and ran. **All five canvases render** where the page had shown a single line
  of placeholder text — including the BMP-round-tripped sprite read back pixel by pixel,
  and the `NSImage(data:)` sprite.
- Linux: `RealDemo` **377 → 387**, +10, every one `cannot find type 'NSBitmapImageRep' in
  scope` — the MUST FIX above, and the only new category. The `.cgColor` and gradient fixes
  cost nothing.
- Windows: not built here; the same members are missing there.

## 2026-07-14 — Auto Layout page never reflowed — and the compiler had been saying so all along

**The page's reflow logic was correct and complete. It was never called once.**

`DemoWindowDelegate` declared:

```swift
func windowDidResize(_ notification: NSNotification)   // Apple: Notification
```

`NSWindowDelegate` is an **`@objc` protocol with optional methods**, discovered at runtime
via `respondsToSelector:`. A near-miss signature is not a witness, is never exposed to
Objective-C, and is **never called**:

| Signature | `responds(to: "windowDidResize:")` |
|---|---|
| the demo's `NSNotification` | **false** — AppKit never calls it |
| Apple's `Notification` | true |

So `reflowAutoLayoutPage(width:)` — which exists, is correct, and handles every container
on the page — ran exactly once at startup and never again. Every box sat static. The demo
used `NSNotification` because that is the **chocolate frameworks' spelling**
(`Sources/WinChocolate/Windows/NSWindow.swift:10`); Foundation's `Notification` value type
exists on all three platforms, so there is no reason for the divergence. Fixed to Apple's
signature — **cost on Linux: zero** (373 → 373).

### 🔎 The compiler was warning about this the whole time — and the build script hid it

Swift emits exactly one signal for this bug class:

```
warning: instance method 'windowDidResize' nearly matches optional requirement
         'windowDidResize' of protocol 'NSWindowDelegate'
```

It is a **warning**, and `run-mac.sh` greps only for `error:` — so it drowned in ~180
routine warnings. `run-mac.sh` now surfaces `nearly matches` after every successful build,
because a clean build was actively misleading: the demo compiled, ran, and reported success
with a fifth of its delegate methods inert.

**This is the same root cause as Issue O and the row-drag writer — the third and fourth
sightings — and it was systemic: the detector found that *ten* delegate methods were
silently dead, a fifth of the demo's delegate surface. All ten are now fixed:**

| Protocol | Method | Was | What had been silently dead |
|---|---|---|---|
| `NSWindowDelegate` | `windowDidResize` | `NSNotification` | **the Auto Layout page never reflowed** |
| `NSTableViewDelegate` | `tableViewSelectionDidChange` | `NSNotification` | table selection status |
| `NSTableViewDelegate` | `tableView(_:rowViewForRow:)` | **`rowViewFor:`** — a wrong *label* | row-view backgrounds |
| `NSOutlineViewDelegate` | `outlineViewSelectionDidChange` | `NSNotification` | outline selection |
| `NSOutlineViewDataSource` | `outlineView(_:pasteboardWriterForItem:)` | **`-> Any?`** | outline drag |
| `NSSplitViewDelegate` | `splitViewDidResizeSubviews` | `NSNotification` | split-resize reporting |
| `NSControlTextEditingDelegate` | `controlTextDidBeginEditing` | `NSNotification` | field editing callbacks |
| `NSControlTextEditingDelegate` | `controlTextDidChange` | `NSNotification` | field editing callbacks |
| `NSControlTextEditingDelegate` | `controlTextDidEndEditing` | `NSNotification` | field editing callbacks |
| `NSTextDelegate` | `textDidChange` | `NSNotification` | text-view edits |

Note the three distinct shapes of near-miss: a **wrong type** (`NSNotification` vs
`Notification`), a **wrong label** (`rowViewFor:` vs `rowViewForRow:`), and a **wrong
return type** (`Any?` vs `NSPasteboardWriting?`). Every one compiles, reads correctly, and
never runs.

**Not one is detectable by testing on Windows or Linux**, because there these are
plain-Swift protocols where a near-miss is either a hard compile error or simply a
different method — the divergence only exists on the Apple side of the build. Which is
precisely what the tri-target demo is for.

**Verified:** every selector now answers `responds(to:) == true`, and the build reports
**0** `nearly matches`.

### 🛠 MUST FIX — WinChocolate and LinChocolate

**Match Apple's exact declarations on every delegate/data-source protocol.** The two
confirmed so far:

| Protocol member | Apple | WinChocolate / LinChocolate |
|---|---|---|
| `NSWindowDelegate.windowDidResize` | `Notification` | **`NSNotification`** |
| `NSTableViewDataSource.tableView(_:pasteboardWriterForRow:)` | `NSPasteboardWriting?` | **`Any?`** |

`Notification` is Foundation, available on Windows and Linux — the `NSNotification`
spelling buys nothing and costs correctness. **Audit every protocol in both frameworks
against Apple's signatures**; the nine rows above are a ready-made worklist, since each one
names a member whose shape the demo copied from the wrong source.

**Files touched**

- `Demo/DemoApplication/main.swift`, `Demo/DemoApplication/DemoConveniences.swift` — all
  ten delegate signatures matched to Apple's
- `run-mac.sh` — surfaces `nearly matches` warnings as dead-delegate diagnostics after
  every successful build

**Verified**

- macOS: builds with **0** `nearly matches` warnings, down from 20 (10 unique). Each of
  the ten selectors independently confirmed `responds(to:) == true`.
- Linux: `RealDemo` **373 → 377**, +4, all `cannot find type 'NSPasteboardWriting' in
  scope` — the outline writer, i.e. the MUST FIX already listed for the table writer. The
  nine `Notification` fixes cost **nothing**, because `Notification` is Foundation and
  exists on all three platforms: the `NSNotification` spelling was pure loss.

## 2026-07-14 — Lists (5.x): browser columns too narrow and not resizable

Two symptoms, **two independent causes**, both AppKit defaults the demo never overrode.
The demo set only `frame`, `delegate` and `loadColumnZero()` — no column sizing at all.

**Measured on a 520-wide browser with the demo's exact data:**

| Config | Visible columns | `width(ofColumn: 0)` | |
|---|---|---|---|
| **A — the demo's defaults** | 5 | **103** | truncated *and* not resizable |
| B — `.userColumnResizing` only | 5 | 102 | resizable, still truncated |
| **C — `.userColumnResizing` + `minColumnWidth = 170`** | 4 | **170** | ✓ what the demo now does |
| D — auto + `minColumnWidth = 170` | 3 | 172 | wide, still **not** resizable |

**1. The divider showed a resize cursor and would not move.** `columnResizingType`
defaults to **`.autoColumnResizing`** — the browser owns its column widths, so a user drag
has nothing to change. `.userColumnResizing` hands them over. Row B proves this is
independent of the width problem: enabling resizing alone widened nothing.

**2. "Application" rendered as "Applicat…".** `minColumnWidth` defaults to **100**, so a
520-wide browser lays out 5 columns of ~103pt. Set to 170, which fits the class names and
gives the user a sensible starting point to drag from. Row D proves this is independent of
the resizing problem: widening alone left the divider dead.

Worth noting the reporting order — the narrow columns are what made the resize worth
trying, and the two looked like one bug. They were not related at all.

### 🛠 MUST FIX — WinChocolate and LinChocolate

**`NSBrowser` has no column-sizing API at all.** Neither framework has any of it:

| API | Apple | WinChocolate | LinChocolate |
|---|---|---|---|
| `NSBrowser.ColumnResizingType` (+ `.noColumnResizing` / `.autoColumnResizing` / `.userColumnResizing`) | ✓ | **absent** | **absent** |
| `columnResizingType` | ✓ (defaults `.auto`) | **absent** | **absent** |
| `minColumnWidth` | ✓ (defaults 100) | **absent** | **absent** |
| `setWidth(_:ofColumn:)` / `width(ofColumn:)` | ✓ | **absent** | **absent** |
| `prefersAllColumnUserResizing` | ✓ | **absent** | **absent** |
| `maxVisibleColumns` | ✓ | **absent** | ✓ |

Without `columnResizingType` a browser cannot offer user-resizable columns at all, and
without `minColumnWidth`/`setWidth` a caller cannot fix the width of a column it knows is
too narrow. Match Apple's defaults too (`.autoColumnResizing`, `minColumnWidth == 100`) —
matching the API but not the defaults just moves the divergence, as the `NSForm.cellSize`
item already shows.

**Files touched**

- `Demo/DemoApplication/main.swift` — `browser.columnResizingType`, `browser.minColumnWidth`

**Verified**

- macOS: built and ran. "Application" / "Controls" / "Tables" render in full where they
  were truncated, in fewer, wider columns.
- Linux: `RealDemo` **361 → 373**; every new error is the MUST FIX above
  (`columnResizingType`, `minColumnWidth`, `.userColumnResizing`). No other category.
- Windows: not built here; the same two members are missing there.

## 2026-07-14 — New in 3.x: colour well never tinted, table drag/edit dead, hint ran into the next column

### 1. The colour well never tinted the glyph

**`NSColorWell` sends its action when its *colour changes*** — and clicking one presents
the shared colour panel by itself. The demo was written for the opposite semantics:

| | `NSColorWell` sends its action… |
|---|---|
| **Apple** | when the **colour changes** |
| **WinChocolate** | when **clicked** — `mouseDown` calls `sendAction()`; the `color` setter only repaints and never sends |

So the handler treated its own action as "the well was clicked", and did this:

```swift
panel.setTarget(panelTarget)          // wire a trampoline to do the tinting…
panel.setAction(DemoActionTarget.fireSelector)
templateTintWell.activate(true)       // …then hand the panel to the well, discarding it
panel.makeKeyAndOrderFront(templateTintWell)
```

Activating a well makes the well the panel's client, so `activate(true)` **overwrites the
target/action set two lines earlier** — the trampoline that was going to tint the glyph
never ran. On Apple the handler therefore fired on *change*, re-opened the panel, and
tinted nothing. Now both wells (this one and the Values page's) simply read `well.color`
in their own action, which is the entire AppKit recipe.

**🛠 MUST FIX — WinChocolate: `NSColorWell` must send its action when the colour changes,
not when clicked.** Firing on click is not AppKit's contract, and the `color` setter
sending nothing means a pick is unobservable through the control's own action — which is
precisely why the demo grew the panel-hijacking workaround. (`NSColorPanel.swift:275`
assigns `winActiveColorWell?.color = color` without sending.)

### 2. The Note column was empty and could not be edited

The delegate returned `nil` for it, with the comment *"the drawn table paints it as text
and edits it in place"*. That is a WinChocolate hybrid — a per-column fallback to drawn
cells. **AppKit has no such thing:** a table is view-based or cell-based, and this one is
view-based because the delegate vends views at all, so a `nil` view means an **empty
cell** with nothing to double-click. The column now vends an editable `NSTextField` like
any other view-based column, and commits edits back to the model through its action.

### 3. Row drag did nothing

**Four separate faults**, each individually sufficient to kill the drag. The demo had the
`.move` source mask, a `pasteboardWriterForRow`, and an `acceptDrop` — and none of it ran.

**3a. The pasteboard writer was invisible to AppKit — the real blocker.**
`NSTableViewDataSource` is an **`@objc` protocol with optional methods**, so AppKit
discovers them with `respondsToSelector:`. A method whose signature does not match the
requirement is not a witness, never gets `@objc`-exposed, and is simply never called:

| Signature | `responds(to: "tableView:pasteboardWriterForRow:")` |
|---|---|
| the demo's `-> Any?` | **false** — AppKit never calls it |
| Apple's `-> NSPasteboardWriting?` | true |

The demo had `-> Any?` because that is what the **chocolate frameworks' own protocol
declares** — it was written against their signature, not Apple's. The drag therefore
carried no data and every row snapped back, with **no error, no warning, nothing in the
console**. The method looked perfectly correct. Fixed to Apple's signature, returning
`NSString` (Swift's `String` does not itself conform to `NSPasteboardWriting`).

**3b. `registerForDraggedTypes(_:)` was never called on the table.** A table only
*receives* drags for types it has registered, so AppKit never routed the drop. Registered
`[.string]`.

**3c. `validateDrop` was not implemented.** Without a validate returning a real operation,
`acceptDrop` is never reached. Returns `.move` for `.above` (the reorder gap).

**3d. Multi-row drag would have moved only one row.** `acceptDrop` read
`draggingPasteboard.string(forType: .string)` and split it on commas — a single-string
format. A writer-per-row produces **one pasteboard item per row**, and `string(forType:)`
returns only the *first* item, so a multi-row drag silently moved a single row. Now reads
`pasteboardItems`.

**3e. The validate rejected the drop across almost the whole table.** With 3a–3d fixed the
row finally *lifted* — and then snapped straight back. The first `validateDrop` returned
`.move` only for `.above` and `[]` otherwise:

```swift
dropOperation == .above ? .move : []      // ← rejects .on
```

But **AppKit proposes `.on` whenever the pointer is over a row's *body***, and `.above`
only in the hairline gap between rows. Rejecting `.on` therefore refused the drop over
nearly the entire table. The standard reorder recipe is to *retarget* it rather than
refuse it:

```swift
if dropOperation == .on {
    tableView.setDropRow(row, dropOperation: .above)   // nearest gap
}
return .move
```

The whole table is a drop target again, while inserts still only ever land between rows.

**3f. Nothing ever reloaded the table — the drop was *succeeding* the whole time.**
`acceptDrop` mutated `tasks`/`notes`/`done`, called `onReorder` (which only set a status
string) and returned `true`. **No `reloadData()` anywhere**, so the table kept rendering
the old order — which looks *exactly* like a drag snapping back. The demo was relying on
the framework reloading itself after a drop; AppKit does not, because the data source owns
the model and only it knows when the model changed.

This one deserves emphasis: after 3a–3e the drop had been **working** — returning `true`,
with the model correctly reordered — and it still looked like a total failure. The symptom
is identical whether the drop is refused or silently invisible, which is why "still the
same" arrived twice. Now:

```swift
tableView.reloadData()
tableView.selectRowIndexes(IndexSet(dest..<(dest + sortedRows.count)), byExtendingSelection: false)
```

**Verified end-to-end** by driving the real drop path with a mock `NSDraggingInfo` (a real
drag cannot be posted here — CGEvent needs accessibility permission):

| Drag | Result | Parallel `notes` array |
|---|---|---|
| row 0 → end | `[Ship, Write, Review]` ✓ | `[nightly, draft, high]` ✓ |
| **rows 0+1 → end** | `[Write, Review, Ship]` ✓ | `[draft, high, nightly]` ✓ |
| row 2 → top | `[Write, Review, Ship]` ✓ | `[draft, high, nightly]` ✓ |
| `validateDrop` | `.above` → `.move` ✓ | `.on` → rejected ✓ |

All three drag selectors now report `responds(to:) == true`.

### 🛠 MUST FIX — WinChocolate and LinChocolate

**`NSPasteboardWriting` must exist, and `tableView(_:pasteboardWriterForRow:)` must be
declared with it.**

| | Type | Data-source signature |
|---|---|---|
| **Apple** | `NSPasteboardWriting` protocol | `-> NSPasteboardWriting?` |
| **WinChocolate** | **absent** | `-> Any?` |
| **LinChocolate** | **absent** | `-> Any?` |

`-> Any?` is not a cosmetic difference. It is the signature the demo copied, and on Apple
it silently unhooks the method — which is exactly the class of bug this project exists to
find. Add the protocol (`NSString`/`NSURL`/`NSPasteboardItem` conforming, as Apple has it)
and declare the data-source method Apple's way.

**The full list of drag API the frameworks are missing**, all of it needed for the plain
AppKit reorder recipe, and all of it now used by the demo:

| API | Apple | WinChocolate | LinChocolate |
|---|---|---|---|
| `NSPasteboardWriting` | ✓ protocol | **absent** | **absent** |
| `tableView(_:pasteboardWriterForRow:)` | `-> NSPasteboardWriting?` | `-> Any?` | `-> Any?` |
| `NSPasteboardItem` | ✓ | ✓ | **absent** |
| `NSPasteboard.pasteboardItems` | ✓ | ✓ | **absent** |
| `NSTableView.setDropRow(_:dropOperation:)` | ✓ | **absent** | **absent** |

`setDropRow` is not optional polish: without it a data source cannot retarget AppKit's
proposed `.on` to the reorder gap, which is the only way to make a whole table a valid
reorder target (see 3e). A framework that omits it cannot express Apple's own reorder
recipe.

**This is the third instance of one root cause, and it deserves a standing audit.**
AppKit discovers optional protocol members via `respondsToSelector:`, so anything that is
not a true `@objc` witness is **invisible at runtime while compiling perfectly**:

1. **Issue O** — a Swift protocol-extension *default* satisfied the Swift compiler but
   added no Objective-C method → `NSBrowser` rejected its delegate.
2. **This** — a *signature mismatch* (`Any?` vs `NSPasteboardWriting?`) → the drag carried
   no data.
3. Any other place either framework's plain-Swift protocol shape differs from Apple's
   `@objc` one.

All three compile clean, run clean, report success, and do nothing. **The frameworks
cannot catch any of them**, because their protocols are plain Swift where Apple's are
`@objc` — the divergence only exists on the Apple side of the build. Every
`@objc`-protocol conformance the demo declares should be audited against Apple's exact
signatures, and the cheap detector is a one-line `responds(to:)` check per optional method.

### 4. The hint ran through the next column

Pure arithmetic: `viewTableHint` was **620 wide starting at x=24** — reaching x=644 —
while the right-hand column starts at **x=520**. It overlapped by 124pt. It is now 480
wide (stopping at 504) and two lines tall.

A taller frame alone would not have fixed it: **an `NSTextField` is single-line by
default**, so the text runs past the edge rather than wrapping. Both hints now set
`usesSingleLineMode = false` and `maximumNumberOfLines = 2` (`lineBreakMode` does not
exist in either chocolate framework, so it is not used), and both tables moved down 16pt
to clear them.

**Files touched**

- `Demo/DemoApplication/main.swift` — both colour-well handlers; note column vends a view;
  `registerForDraggedTypes` + `validateDrop`; hint frames/wrapping; both tables lowered

**Verified**

- macOS: built and ran. The Note column now shows its values (`high` / `nightly` /
  `draft`) where it was blank; the hint wraps to two lines and clears the right column;
  the row-drag path is verified end-to-end (table above).
- Linux: `RealDemo` **355 → 361**, net +6, from two opposing moves: deleting the
  colour-panel trampoline *fixed* 8, and the AppKit-correct drag API cost 14
  (`NSPasteboardWriting`, `NSPasteboardItem`, `pasteboardItems`, `setDropRow` — the MUST
  FIX table above). No other new error category.
- Windows: not built here. WinChocolate already has `pasteboardItems`/`NSPasteboardItem`;
  it needs `NSPasteboardWriting` and `setDropRow`.

**What this cost, and the lesson.** Row drag took **six** fixes (3a–3f), each individually
sufficient to make it fail, and **four of the six produce the identical symptom** — "the
row snaps back". That is why it was reported broken three times in a row: peeling off one
fault revealed the next behind the same appearance.

3a–3d were verified directly (`responds(to:)` checks; a mock `NSDraggingInfo` driving the
real drop path, including the multi-row reorder maths). 3e and 3f were reasoned from
AppKit's documented behavior — a real drag cannot be posted here without accessibility
permission. 3f in particular is worth internalising: **the drop was already succeeding**
(returning `true`, model correctly reordered) and still looked like total failure, because
a view that is never told to redraw is indistinguishable from one that refused the work.
"Snaps back" was never evidence of rejection.

## 2026-07-14 — Caption sweep across every page; table sorted *and* selected; image not clickable

### 1. Every caption, every page

`NSTextField(string:)` is real AppKit for an **editable, bordered, background-drawing**
field — that is its documented job, and AppKit's answer for a caption is
`NSTextField(labelWithString:)`, which is exactly these four properties. The demo carries
frames, so a single sweep after every page is assembled now demotes all 59 captions:

```swift
caption.isBordered = false
caption.drawsBackground = false
caption.isEditable = false
caption.isSelectable = false
```

One place decides what is a caption; the demo's four real input fields
(`editableTextField`, `priceField`, `contactNameField`, `contactStatusField`) are listed
separately and never touched. `statusLabel`/`focusLabel` keep `drawsBackground` — they are
deliberate colored panels whose `backgroundColor` `applyLiveAppearanceRefresh()` re-resolves
on a theme switch — but lose their borders like everything else. The Nib page's labels are
excluded: that page is fenced out of the macOS build (18.11) and already sets these itself.

**This also fixes the keyboard bug:** `counterLabel` was an editable field, so it took first
responder and swallowed typing — during testing its text became `"ough for the apple clock"`.
It is a caption now and no longer eats input.

### 2. Table selected a whole column when sorting

The demo set **`tableView.allowsColumnSelection = true`**, whose AppKit default is `false`:

| | Behaviour |
|---|---|
| `allowsColumnSelection = false` (Apple's default) | header click **sorts only**; `selectColumnIndexes` is a **no-op** |
| `allowsColumnSelection = true` (what the demo asked for) | header click **selects the entire column** |

So AppKit was doing exactly what it was told: every sort click highlighted the whole Name
column, and `selectColumnIndexes([0])` pre-highlighted it at launch. Removed both; header
clicks now sort without selecting, and the row selection is the only one that survives.
Nothing read the column selection (the only `selectedColumn` in the demo is on the
unrelated `NSMatrix`).

### 3. Image did not cycle on click

**`NSImageView` never sends its action when clicked.** `NSImageCell` has no action
tracking, so `target`/`action` on a plain `NSImageView` is silently inert. Verified against
real AppKit:

```
NSImageView: isEditable=false isEnabled=true cell=NSImageCell
  after mouseDown,     action fired 0 times  -> CLICK DOES NOT SEND ACTION
  after performClick,  action fired 0 times
```

Not even `performClick(_:)` fires it. `imageView.onAction` could therefore never run on
Apple — the demo had been written against WinChocolate's non-Apple behavior of sending an
action on click. Apple marks `NSImageView` **`open`** precisely so callers can add the
behavior they need, so the demo now has a `DemoClickableImageView: NSImageView` that
overrides `mouseDown(with:)`. (An overlay `NSButton` with `isTransparent` would be the
other AppKit answer — neither framework has `isTransparent`, so that route was closed.)

### 4. Clip view — no bug found

Checked because it was suspected. The Home/Center/Corner buttons are wired, and
`NSClipView.scroll(to:)` on a standalone clip view behaves correctly on AppKit — measured
`documentVisibleRect.origin` following each button's target exactly:

| `scroll(to:)` | resulting `documentVisibleRect.origin` |
|---|---|
| `0,0` | `0,0` ✓ |
| `100,55` | `100,55` ✓ |
| `220,110` | `220,110` ✓ |

`reflectScrolledClipView` is not applicable — the clip view is standalone, not inside an
`NSScrollView`. Nothing changed here.

### 5. "Scroll Selected" selected a row instead of scrolling to the selection

The button did neither of the things its name promises:

```swift
let targetRow = max(0, tableView.numberOfRows - 1)              // the LAST row…
tableView.selectRowIndexes([targetRow], byExtendingSelection: false)  // …and SELECT it
tableView.scrollRowToVisible(targetRow)
```

That is "select the last row and scroll there" — a different feature, and it destroys the
selection the button is supposed to reveal. Now it scrolls the *existing* selection into
view and leaves it alone (`selectedRow` is `-1` when empty, as on Apple, so the no-selection
case is handled explicitly rather than silently selecting row 0).

**Why it was probably written that way — and a MUST FIX it exposes.**
`scrollRowToVisible(_:)` is an **empty no-op stub in both frameworks**:

| | `scrollRowToVisible(_:)` |
|---|---|
| **Apple** | scrolls the row into view |
| **WinChocolate** | `open func scrollRowToVisible(_ row: Int) {}` — **does nothing** |
| **LinChocolate** | `func scrollRowToVisible(_ row: Int) {}` in `DemoCompat` — **does nothing** |

With scrolling a no-op on Windows, selecting a row was the only way to make the button do
something visible — so the demo was shaped around a framework stub. Both must implement it.
A silent no-op is the worst failure mode available: it compiles, it runs, it reports
success, and it is only detectable by watching the screen.

### 🛠 MUST FIX — LinChocolate

**`NSImageView` must be `open`, as Apple's is.**

| | Declaration |
|---|---|
| **Apple** | `open class NSImageView : NSControl` |
| **WinChocolate** | `open class NSImageView : NSControl` ✓ |
| **LinChocolate** | `public **final** class NSImageView : NSView` ✗ |

`final` forbids what Apple explicitly permits, and it is the *only* thing blocking the
click fix on Linux — `error: inheritance from a final class 'NSImageView'`. Subclassing is
the documented way to extend an image view; a framework claiming AppKit parity cannot
forbid it. LinChocolate's `NSImageView` also derives from `NSView` rather than `NSControl`,
so it has no `target`/`action` at all — both should be corrected together. **The whole
surface should be audited for stray `final`**: every `final` that Apple leaves `open` is
the same bug, and each one only surfaces when someone tries to subclass.

**This is the one item where the demo currently does not build on Linux** (`RealDemo`
351 → 355, all four errors this). The demo was left AppKit-correct rather than bent around
the divergence: the alternative — an overlay `NSButton` with `isTransparent` — is also
unavailable in both frameworks, and reverting to `imageView.onAction` would restore a call
that provably never fires on Apple. Fixing `final` clears it with no demo change.

### 🛠 MUST FIX — WinChocolate and LinChocolate

**`NSTableView.scrollRowToVisible(_:)` must actually scroll.** Both ship it as an empty
stub (see item 5 above), which silently shaped the demo around it. Implement it, and audit
for sibling no-op stubs — `LinChocolate/Compat/DemoCompat.swift` is where its stub lives,
which makes that file a good place to start looking for others.

**Files touched**

- `Demo/DemoApplication/main.swift` — caption sweep (59); `allowsColumnSelection` /
  `selectColumnIndexes` removed; `DemoClickableImageView` added and wired

**Verified**

- macOS: built and ran. Every caption is borderless on Controls/Values/Tables; the table
  selects one row and sorts without column highlighting; the image view has a real click
  path.
- Linux: `RealDemo` **351 → 355**. The four new errors are all
  `inheritance from a final class 'NSImageView'` — the MUST FIX above, and the only new
  category. Everything else in this change (captions, table flags) uses API present in
  both frameworks.

## 2026-07-14 — Values page: boxed captions, dead progress bar, clipped clock, dead scroller

Four bugs, all demo-side, all caused by an **AppKit default the demo never overrode**.
Three of the four are the same lesson: AppKit's defaults are not the chocolate
frameworks' defaults, and the demo had been written against the latter without noticing.

### 1. Captions drawn as boxed input fields

Identical to the Controls page: `NSTextField(string:)` builds an **editable, bordered**
field. Applied the demo's caption idiom to all 13 — `Slider:`, `Vert:`, `Progress:`,
`Stepper:`, `Combo:`, `Search:`, `Level:`, `Color:`, `Segments:`, `Scroller:`, `Date:`,
`Calendar:`, `Rating:`.

### 2. Progress bar ignored the slider

**`NSProgressIndicator.isIndeterminate` defaults to `true` on AppKit**, and an
indeterminate bar **ignores `doubleValue` entirely** — it stores the value and animates a
barber pole instead. Measured:

```
NSProgressIndicator defaults: isIndeterminate=true style=0 min=0.0 max=100.0
after setting doubleValue=82 while indeterminate: doubleValue=82.0  (stored, but not drawn)
```

The slider's action *was* firing all along (its value label tracked correctly) — the bar
simply wasn't a determinate bar. Fixed with `progressIndicator.isIndeterminate = false`.
Note the sibling `activityIndicator` sets `isIndeterminate = true` explicitly and is
correct as-is; only the determinate bar was relying on a default that differs from Apple's.

### 3. Clock clipped off the right edge

A `.clockAndCalendar` picker draws a calendar **and** a clock side by side. Measured:

| | Size |
|---|---|
| what the demo gave it | 224 × 168 |
| `intrinsicContentSize` on AppKit | **275.5 × 148** |

~52pt too narrow, so the clock was cut off. Widened to **276**.

**The 168 height is deliberate and stays.** It exists to accommodate WinChocolate's
calendar, and AppKit is happy in a taller frame — 148 is its *minimum*, not its maximum.
Only the width was wrong.

### 4. Scroller drew no knob and did not respond

**`NSScroller` starts `isEnabled = false`** — unlike every other control — which pins
`usableParts` at `.noScrollerParts`, so no knob is drawn and nothing responds, no matter
how `doubleValue`, `knobProportion` or `scrollerStyle` are set. Measured:

| State | `isEnabled` | `usableParts` |
|---|---|---|
| default (what the demo had) | **false** | `0` — no parts, dead track |
| after `isEnabled = true` | true | **`2` = `.allScrollerParts`** ✓ |

The demo already set `doubleValue` and `knobProportion`; the control was simply disabled.
Ruled out the tempting explanation first — `NSScroller.preferredScrollerStyle` is
`1` (**overlay**, which auto-hides) — by rendering all four style variants and confirming
**none** drew a knob. The style was never the problem. Fixed with `scroller.isEnabled = true`.

**Files touched**

- `Demo/DemoApplication/main.swift` — 13 captions; `isIndeterminate`; calendar width;
  `scroller.isEnabled`

**Verified**

- macOS: built and ran. Captions are captions; the bar tracks the slider; the clock is
  fully visible with the 168 height retained; the scroller shows a knob at 0.25.
- Linux: `RealDemo` error count **unchanged at 351** — every property used
  (`isIndeterminate`, `isEnabled`, the caption properties) exists in both frameworks.

**Follow-up — the `Clicks:` label steals keyboard input.** `counterLabel`
(`main.swift:1527`) is `NSTextField(string: "Clicks: 0")`, i.e. an editable field. It
takes first responder and swallows typing: during testing it captured stray keystrokes
and its text became `"ough for the apple clock"`. Same caption bug, but on the shared
header rather than the Values page, so it is untouched here. It affects **every page** and
is actively eating keyboard input — the remaining captions across all pages want the same
sweep.

## 2026-07-14 — Cover `NSForm` *and* its replacement; both are supported API

**Why there are now two form sections.** **Deprecated is not removed.** `NSForm` still
ships, still compiles and still works on macOS today, so **WinChocolate and LinChocolate
must support it at full parity for exactly as long as Apple does** — and must support the
recommended replacement alongside it. The demo therefore exercises both, and will keep
exercising both until Apple actually withdraws `NSForm`. The duplication is coverage of
two supported APIs, not a display of our own gap: **both sections must render correctly
on all three targets.**

| Position | What | Label |
|---|---|---|
| original spot (`y=120`) | **the replacement** — plain `NSTextField` rows | `Form:` |
| below the button matrix (`y=372`) | **the deprecated original** — `NSForm` | `Form:` + `NSForm — deprecated (macOS 10.10)` |

Apple's own deprecation text names the replacement: *"Use NSTextField directly instead,
and consider NSStackView for layout assistance."* The demo takes the `NSTextField`
half — `NSStackView` would add nothing here (two static rows) and LinChocolate's
`NSStackView` is a stub, so frame-positioned fields keep the page honest on all three.

**Borders.** The replacement rows need nothing — an `NSTextField` already carries the
same bezel as `Type here:`, `Password:` and `Price:`.

The deprecated `NSForm` was the opposite: its entries drew a heavy **white square
outline** in dark mode, unlike anything else on the page. The flags were not the cause —
`NSFormCell`'s defaults are already identical to `NSTextField`'s (`isBezeled = true`,
`isBordered = false`). The cause is the **cell class**: `NSFormCell` descends from
`NSActionCell` and draws an old-style bezel, while `NSTextField` uses `NSTextFieldCell`'s
modern one. `NSFormCell` has **no `bezelStyle`**, so the rounded bezel is unreachable.
Measured what is reachable:

| Config | Result |
|---|---|
| defaults (bezeled) | thick **white** square bezel — the reported problem |
| `setBezeled(false)` | no border at all |
| **`setBezeled(false)` + `setBordered(true)`** | thin subtle border — closest match ✓ |

So the demo uses the third. It is as close to the page's other fields as `NSForm` can
get, and the residual difference is itself a fair illustration of why Apple deprecated
the class.

**The `#if` is temporary scaffolding, and it must not survive.** Three calls are needed
to make `NSForm` render on Apple, and none exist on Win/Lin, so today they can only be
written conditionally:

```swift
#if !canImport(WinChocolate) && !canImport(LinChocolate)
form.cellSize = NSMakeSize(256, 26)   // rows collapse without it
form.setBezeled(false)                // else a heavy white outline
form.setBordered(true)
#endif
```

It is **not** a shim — it defines no missing API and fakes nothing; it sets real AppKit
properties that real AppKit requires. But it **is** AppKit-only code in a demo whose
whole purpose is that one source means one thing everywhere, so it is a defect to be
retired, not a pattern to copy. It exists solely because of the **MUST FIX** items below,
it is parked at the call site where it cannot be missed, and **every line of it is
deleted the day both frameworks match Apple.** Its presence is the measure of the debt.

### 🛠 MUST FIX — WinChocolate and LinChocolate

**Not optional, and not "legacy support".** `NSForm` is deprecated but **fully supported
API** — Apple ships it, our demo exercises it, and so both frameworks owe it exact parity
until Apple removes it. Each item below is a real divergence from Apple's surface, and
together they are the only reason the `#if` above exists.

**1. `NSForm.cellSize`, with Apple's `NSMatrix` semantics.** Apple's `NSForm` is an
`NSMatrix` subclass; both frameworks invented `rowHeight` instead and inherit from
`NSControl`/`NSView`. The intersection is empty, so *no* line the demo can write sizes
the rows on all three:

| | Row-height API |
|---|---|
| **AppKit** | `cellSize` (from `NSMatrix`) |
| **WinChocolate** | `rowHeight` — invented, not AppKit |
| **LinChocolate** | `rowHeight` — invented, not AppKit |

Preferably make `NSForm` a real `NSMatrix` subclass (bringing `cellSize`,
`intercellSpacing`, `autosizesCells`) and retire `rowHeight`. At minimum, expose
`cellSize` with Apple's semantics — **including the part that bites**: a matrix built
with `init(frame:)` starts at `cellSize.height == 0`, so rows collapse until the caller
sets it. Matching Apple means matching that default, not "helpfully" defaulting to 30.
Once it lands, the demo writes `form.cellSize = NSMakeSize(256, 26)` unconditionally.

**2. `NSFormCell` bezel/border control.** Apple's `NSFormCell` descends from
`NSActionCell` and inherits `isBezeled` / `isBordered` from `NSCell`; `NSForm` exposes
`setBezeled(_:)` / `setBordered(_:)`. Both chocolate `NSFormCell`s carry only
`title` / `titleWidth` / `stringValue`, so the demo cannot restyle the entries there at
all. Add Apple's accessors (`NSForm.setBezeled(_:)`, `setBordered(_:)`,
`setEntryWidth(_:)`, `setInterlineSpacing(_:)`, `setTitleFont(_:)`, `setTextFont(_:)`,
`setTitleAlignment(_:)`, `setTextAlignment(_:)` — all of which real `NSForm` responds to).

**3. Deprecation annotations, matching Apple's state.** Apple marks `NSForm` deprecated
since macOS 10.10, and the AppKit build emits:

```
warning: 'NSForm' was deprecated in macOS 10.10: Use NSTextField directly instead,
         and consider NSStackView for layout assistance
```

WinChocolate and LinChocolate emit **nothing** — they present `NSForm` as current API.
That is a faithfulness divergence in its own right: a framework's deprecation state is
part of its public surface, and the compiler is how developers learn it. Both frameworks
must carry `@available(..., deprecated:, message:)` wherever Apple does, with Apple's
version and message, so the same source produces the same warnings on all three targets.
`NSForm`/`NSFormCell` are the known case; the whole surface should be **audited against
Apple's annotations**, since anything Apple deprecated and we present as current is the
same bug. (Consequence to accept: once annotated, this demo will emit the deprecation
warning on all three — which is correct, and is the point.)

Note what an annotation is **not**: a licence to drop the API. Deprecated means *still
supported*, so annotating `NSForm` and fixing items 1–2 are the same job — the framework
must warn about it **and** implement it exactly, for as long as Apple does. The day Apple
removes `NSForm`, both frameworks remove it and the demo drops the deprecated section;
not before.

**Files touched**

- `Demo/DemoApplication/main.swift` — added `contactNameLabel` / `contactNameField` /
  `contactStatusLabel` / `contactStatusField` at the original spot; moved `form` +
  `deprecatedFormLabel` + `deprecatedFormNote` below the matrix; the `#if` now also
  carries the bezel/border calls

**Verified**

- macOS: built and ran. The replacement renders as two clean rows whose bezels match the
  page's other fields. The deprecated `NSForm` sits below the matrix under its label,
  with both rows laid out and a subtle border in place of the white outline.
- Linux: `RealDemo` error count **unchanged at 351** — the `#if` excludes it, and the
  replacement rows use only `NSTextField`.
- Windows: not built (no Win32 toolchain here). The `#if` excludes it; the replacement
  rows use only `NSTextField`.

## 2026-07-14 — Pop-up sized for Win32, captions built as input fields, unreadable popover, collapsed `NSForm`

Four separate bugs on the Controls page, all fixed demo-side.

### 1. `NSPopUpButton` sized with a Win32 drop-down height

**Symptom.** The Alert Style pop-up rendered far too tall and overflowed the bottom of
its `NSBox` by 46pt.

**Root cause.** The frame was `NSMakeRect(472, 186, 184, 96)`. **96** is a Win32
convention: a `COMBOBOX`'s creation height must include its drop-down list. On AppKit
(and GTK) the frame is just the button, which is ~26pt — WinChocolate's own
`intrinsicContentSize` says `height: 26`.

**Fix.** Height `96` → `26`. **Safe on Windows:** WinChocolate already absorbs the
Win32 quirk itself — `Win32PopUpControls.createPopUpButton` does
`height: max(frame.size.height, 160)` and tracks the drop-down height separately, so
the demo never needed to encode it.

### 2. Captions built as editable, bordered text fields

**Symptom.** `Alert style:`, `Form:` and `Matrix:` drew as rounded input fields rather
than captions. In the popover it was worse: the title showed a **focus ring and
selected text**, because it *was* an editable field that had taken focus.

**Root cause.** `NSTextField(string:)` is real AppKit, and it builds an **editable,
bordered, background-drawing** field — that is its documented purpose. A caption must
switch all of that off; the demo already knew this (`showcaseSectionLabel` does exactly
that) but these five sites didn't.

**Fix.** Applied the demo's existing caption idiom to `alertStyleLabel`, `formLabel`,
`matrixLabel`, `popoverTitle` and `popoverInfo`:

```swift
caption.isBordered = false
caption.drawsBackground = false
caption.isEditable = false
caption.isSelectable = false
```

### 3. Popover unreadable in dark mode

**Symptom.** Dark field bezels and a nearly invisible `Close` button on a light cream
surface — illegible.

**Root cause.** The content view hardcoded a **light** background
(`calibratedRed: 1.0, green: 0.94, blue: 0.84`) while its child controls and dynamic
label colors still resolved against the **dark** system appearance. A fixed light
surface under near-white dynamic text cannot work.

**Fix.** Resolve the surface from the appearance, using the demo's own established
idiom (the same one the collection-view section bands use), and let captions take
dynamic `.labelColor`:

```swift
let popoverDark = NSApplication.shared.effectiveAppearance.bestMatch(from: [.aqua, .darkAqua]) == .darkAqua
popoverContent.backgroundColor = popoverDark
    ? NSColor(calibratedRed: 0.26, green: 0.22, blue: 0.16, alpha: 1.0)   // warm dark
    : NSColor(calibratedRed: 1.00, green: 0.94, blue: 0.84, alpha: 1.0)   // cream
```

`NSView.appearance` would have been the tidier AppKit answer (pin the subtree to
`.aqua` and keep the cream in both modes), but **LinChocolate has no `NSView.appearance`**
— so it would not compile on all three. The appearance-resolving idiom above works
everywhere.

**Files touched**

- `Demo/DemoApplication/main.swift` — pop-up frame, five caption sites, popover surface

**Verified**

- macOS: built and ran. The pop-up now sits inside the Alert Style box; the three
  captions render as captions. The popover was verified in an isolated harness
  reproducing the exact construction (a synthetic click could not be posted — CGEvent
  and System Events both need accessibility permission this machine hasn't granted).
  It reproduced the reported bug precisely in *dark — before*, and is legible in both
  appearances after.
- Linux: `RealDemo` went **339 → 351** errors, and a message-level diff confirms the
  *only* new category is `NSAppearance.bestMatch` / `.aqua` / `.darkAqua` (11 → 13
  instances) — from the single `bestMatch` call added for the popover surface. That is
  a **pre-existing LinChocolate gap**, not a new kind of breakage: the demo already
  used `bestMatch` at 10 other sites, and it is real AppKit that LinChocolate has yet
  to implement. Every other property used (`isBordered`, `drawsBackground`,
  `isEditable`, `isSelectable`, `textColor`, `labelColor`) was checked to exist in both
  frameworks before building.
- Windows: not built (no Win32 toolchain here). The pop-up height change is safe by
  inspection of `Win32PopUpControls`, and all other API used exists in WinChocolate.

**Follow-up:** LinChocolate needs `NSAppearance.bestMatch(from:)` plus `.aqua` /
`.darkAqua`. It is the demo's standard way to resolve the appearance (11 sites) and is
plain AppKit, so LinChocolate cannot render any appearance-aware demo content until it
lands.

### 4. `NSForm` rows collapsed on top of each other

**Symptom.** `Name:` and `Status:` drew on the same line, overlapping, with a stray
thin white bar to the right.

**Root cause.** Apple's `NSForm` is an **`NSMatrix` subclass**, and a matrix built with
`init(frame:)` starts with **`cellSize.height == 0`**. Every row is therefore zero-tall:
the white bar was a collapsed entry field, and the 3pt offset between the two titles was
simply the default `intercellSpacing`. The caller must set the cell size — the demo
already knew this for its `NSMatrix` (`matrix.cellSize = …`) and just never did it for
`NSForm`.

Measured on real AppKit — **nothing else works**, only an explicit assignment:

| Attempt | resulting `cellSize` | row frames |
|---|---|---|
| **baseline (what the demo did)** | `(256, **0.0**)` | `y=0 h=0`, `y=3 h=0` — collapsed |
| `form.font` before *or* after `addEntry` | `(256, 0.0)` | collapsed |
| `autosizesCells = true` | `(256, 0.0)` | collapsed |
| `sizeToCells()` | `(256, 0.0)` | *worse* — shrinks the form to `h=3` |
| **`form.cellSize = NSMakeSize(256, 26)`** | `(256, 26)` | `y=0 h=26`, `y=29 h=26` ✓ |

> **Superseded by the entry above (same day).** The `#if` described below still exists,
> but it now guards the *deprecated* `NSForm` section, which moved below the button
> matrix — the original position shows Apple's recommended `NSTextField` replacement
> instead. The gap it marks is recorded as a **MUST ADD** for both frameworks there. The
> measurements below still stand.

**Fix — and why it carries a `#if`.** This is the one place the demo cannot state
itself identically on all three targets:

| | Row-height API |
|---|---|
| **AppKit** | `cellSize` (inherited from `NSMatrix`) |
| **WinChocolate** | `rowHeight` — **invented, not AppKit** |
| **LinChocolate** | `rowHeight` — **invented, not AppKit** |

The intersection is empty: `cellSize` does not compile on Win/Lin, and `rowHeight` does
not exist on Apple. Both frameworks size their rows internally, which is exactly why the
form looks right there and collapsed only on Apple. So the assignment is scoped to the
target that requires it, with the debt stated at the call site rather than hidden in a
helper:

```swift
#if !canImport(WinChocolate) && !canImport(LinChocolate)
form.cellSize = NSMakeSize(256, 26)
#endif
```

**This `#if` is a marker of a framework divergence, not a shim** — it defines no missing
API and fakes nothing; it sets a real AppKit property that real AppKit requires. It
should be deleted the moment WinChocolate and LinChocolate expose Apple's `cellSize`
(ideally by making `NSForm` an `NSMatrix` subclass, as on Apple, and retiring the
invented `rowHeight`). Tracked with Issue I.

**Verified.** macOS: built and ran — `Name: [WinChocolate]` and `Status: [Native]` now
render as two properly stacked rows, no overlap, no white bar. Linux: `RealDemo` error
count **unchanged at 351**, confirming the `#if` correctly excludes it.

**Aside:** the probe surfaced that **`NSForm` is deprecated as of macOS 10.10**
("Use NSTextField directly instead, and consider NSStackView for layout assistance").
It still works, and the demo exercises it deliberately, but that is worth knowing before
investing further in `NSForm` parity.

## 2026-07-14 — Flip every demo view to a top-left origin

**Symptom.** Every page rendered upside down on real AppKit: content piled at the
bottom of the window with empty space above, and overlapping labels. On the Controls
page, `Clicks: 0` sat at the very bottom and `Tokens/Price` near the top — exactly
inverted.

**Root cause.** The demo is authored entirely in **top-left coordinates**. It never had
to declare that, because WinChocolate hardcodes `open var isFlipped: Bool { true }` —
every view there is top-left, always. LinChocolate papers over it differently, with a
non-Apple static (`NSView.defaultIsFlipped = true`, main.swift line 45, inside
`#if canImport(LinChocolate)`). Real AppKit is the only target that reads `isFlipped`
honestly, and its default is `false` (bottom-left origin) — so the authored layout
inverted.

**Fix.** Override `isFlipped` on the demo's own view subclasses. This is plain AppKit
(`NSView.isFlipped` is an overridable property Apple documents for exactly this), so it
is a no-op on Windows/Linux and corrects macOS:

```swift
/// The demo is authored in top-left coordinates (see `DemoFilledView`).
override var isFlipped: Bool {
    true
}
```

| Target | `isFlipped` default | Effect of the override |
|---|---|---|
| WinChocolate | `{ true }` — always | no change |
| LinChocolate | `defaultIsFlipped` (set true at line 45) | no change |
| **AppKit** | `false` (bottom-left) | **fixes the inversion** |

Applied to all 12 demo `NSView` subclasses:

- **Containers** (position subviews by frame): `DemoContentView`, `DemoPageView`,
  `DemoFilledView`
- **Custom-drawing views**: `DemoCanvasView`, `DemoShapesView`, `DemoGradientsView`,
  `DemoSlowGradientView`, `DemoCoreGraphicsView`, `DemoHoverView`, `DemoDragHandle`,
  `DemoDropWell`, `DemoPrintSample`

Also converted the three plain `NSView` containers to `DemoPageView`, since a bare
`NSView` has no override and would have stayed inverted: `noteContent`,
`stressDocView`, `panelContent`.

**The non-obvious half — drawing views are separate.** A flipped *superview* repositions
a subview's frame but does **not** change that subview's own drawing origin. So after
fixing the containers, the Drawing page still *looked* plausible while its artwork was
vertically mirrored — the shapes are symmetric enough to hide it. Reading the source
rather than the render proved it, and fixing it moved four elements:

| Element | Code | Before | After |
|---|---|---|---|
| `"WinChocolate"` text | `at: (14, 10)` | bottom-left | **top-left** ✓ |
| phoenix image | `draw(in: (330, 16, …))` | bottom-right | **top-right** ✓ |
| red ellipse | `ovalIn: (60, 228, …)` | top-left | **bottom-left** ✓ |
| gradient labels | small y | below swatches | **above** ✓ |

The five-point star (apex `(100, 75)`, legs at `y = 210.7`) now points up rather than
down. Eyeballing the render alone would have shipped this page silently wrong.

**Files touched**

- `Demo/DemoApplication/main.swift` — 11 overrides, 3 container type swaps
- `Demo/DemoApplication/DemoConveniences.swift` — 1 override (`DemoFilledView`)

**Verified**

- macOS: built and **ran**; Controls, Values and Drawing pages render top-down
  correctly (`Clicks: 0` at top, `Tokens/Price` at bottom).
- Linux: `RealDemo` error count **unchanged at 339**, no `isFlipped`/`DemoPageView`
  errors — the shared source still means the same thing there. (That 339 is
  pre-existing breakage on this branch, unrelated to this change: HEAD without any of
  it is 347.)
- Windows: not built (no Win32 toolchain on this machine). The override is a no-op
  there by construction, since WinChocolate's `isFlipped` is already `true`.

**Notes / follow-ups**

- `NSView.defaultIsFlipped = true` (main.swift line 45) is a **LinChocolate-only
  static, not AppKit API**. It is now redundant for the demo's own views, but still
  governs framework-vended containers on Linux, so it was left in place. Removing it is
  a candidate once LinChocolate's containers are addressed.
- **Still broken on the Controls page, and not a coordinate problem:** the `NSForm`
  rows do not lay out — `Name:` and `Status:` overlap on a single line with a stray
  white bar beside them. Tracked as Issue I (`NSForm` accessors).

## 2026-07-14 — Implement all four item-based `NSBrowser` delegate methods

> Backfilled. Predates the demo-only phase, but the fix was **demo-only** — the
> framework was hiding a demo bug. Framework analysis: Issue O.

**Symptom.** Logged at launch on real AppKit, after which the browser was rejected
outright and stayed empty:

```
*** Illegal NSBrowser delegate (<WinChocolateDemo.DemoBrowserDataSource: 0x…>).
    Must implement browser:willDisplayCell:atRow:column: and either
    browser:numberOfRowsInColumn: or browser:createRowsForColumn:inMatrix:
```

**Root cause — and the message is misleading.** It names the *matrix-based* methods,
but AppKit does not want them: it names the interface it **fell back to**. AppKit fully
supports the modern *item-based* delegate the demo uses, and every method
`DemoBrowserDataSource` implemented was a genuine AppKit method.

The item-based interface requires **all four** of `browser(_:numberOfChildrenOfItem:)`,
`browser(_:child:ofItem:)`, `browser(_:isLeafItem:)` and
`browser(_:objectValueForItem:)`. AppKit probes for them with `respondsToSelector:`; if
any one is missing it concludes the delegate isn't item-based and falls back to the
matrix interface — which the delegate also doesn't implement. Hence "Illegal delegate".

The demo implemented only the first three. It compiled and worked on Windows anyway,
because **WinChocolate supplies `objectValueForItem` as a Swift protocol-extension
default**. A Swift extension default is static dispatch: it adds no Objective-C method,
so it is **invisible to `respondsToSelector:`**. The framework's convenience made the
demo *look* complete while it was missing a method Apple requires — and the gap could
only ever surface at runtime, on Apple.

**Fix.** The demo implements the fourth method itself:

```swift
func browser(_ browser: NSBrowser, objectValueForItem item: Any?) -> Any? {
    item.map { String(describing: $0) }
}
```

This is the no-shim rule doing its job: the demo line was wrong, and the framework was
concealing it. The method is plain AppKit and overrides WinChocolate's default
harmlessly.

**Files touched**

- `Demo/DemoApplication/main.swift` — `DemoBrowserDataSource`

**Verified**

- macOS: built and ran; the "Illegal NSBrowser delegate" error is gone.
- Linux: LinChocolate's `NSBrowserDelegate` declares only three methods, so the fourth
  is simply an extra method on the class — harmless, but LinChocolate won't call it.
  Aligning that protocol is tracked with Issue G.

**Notes / follow-ups**

- **Generalized risk worth auditing.** Any Swift protocol-extension default in either
  framework that stands in for a method AppKit probes via `respondsToSelector:` is a
  latent runtime divergence of exactly this shape — and it is *more* dangerous than a
  compile error, because the frameworks report success. Candidates: the remaining
  `NSBrowserDelegate` defaults (`isLeafItem`, `titleOfColumn`, `imageForItem`) and any
  other `public extension …Delegate`.

## 2026-07-14 — Register and dequeue collection-view supplementary views

> Backfilled. Predates the demo-only phase, and unlike the entries above it **also
> required framework changes** — the register/dequeue API did not exist in either
> framework. Framework analysis and the `required init(frame:)` consequence: Issue N.

**Symptom.** Hard **crash on launch** on real AppKit (`EXC_BREAKPOINT` via
`+[NSApplication _crashOnException:]`):

```
*** Assertion failure in -[_NSCollectionViewCore
      _createPreparedSupplementaryViewForElementOfKind:atIndexPath:withLayoutAttributes:applyAttributes:]
the view returned from -collectionView:viewForSupplementaryElementOfKind:
  UICollectionElementKindSectionFooter atIndexPath:{length = 2, path = 0 - 0}
  was not retrieved by calling -makeSupplementaryViewOfKind:withIdentifier:forIndexPath:
  or is nil (<NSTextField: 0x…>)
```

**Root cause.** `DemoFlowCollectionDataSource` built each section header/footer fresh
and returned it. AppKit requires every supplementary view to be **registered** under a
kind+identifier and then **dequeued** via `makeSupplementaryView`. Both frameworks
accepted any view handed back — WinChocolate's source said so outright ("deferred to
Rev 2.0") — so the demo was written to that laxer contract.

Measured against real AppKit with an isolated repro; Apple requires **both** halves:

| Data source returns | Result |
|---|---|
| a freshly-built view (the old demo) | **crash** |
| `register(class)` + `makeSupplementaryView` | **works** |
| `makeSupplementaryView` with no prior `register` | **crash** |

**Fix.** Register the class per kind, then dequeue and configure in the data source:

```swift
static let headerID = NSUserInterfaceItemIdentifier("DemoSectionHeader")
static let footerID = NSUserInterfaceItemIdentifier("DemoSectionFooter")
…
let header = collectionView.makeSupplementaryView(
    ofKind: kind, withIdentifier: Self.headerID, for: indexPath) as! NSTextField
header.stringValue = "  \(section.title)"
```

Because views are now **recycled** rather than built fresh, every visual property must
be set on each vend (`drawsBackground`, `isEditable`, `isBordered`, font, colors) — a
reused view carries the previous section's state.

**Registration order matters, and getting it wrong is baffling.** Measured on AppKit:

| Order | Result |
|---|---|
| `register(…)` then set `collectionViewLayout` | **crash** — registration silently lost |
| set `collectionViewLayout` then `register(…)` | **works** |

Assigning the layout **discards existing registrations**. When that happens,
`makeSupplementaryView` falls back to loading a **nib named after the identifier**, and
it surfaces as the thoroughly misleading `-[NSNib _initWithNibNamed:bundle:options:]
could not load the nib 'DemoSectionFooter'`. The demo now registers *after* the layout
is assigned and documents why at the call site.

**Items are NOT affected — a correction.** An earlier prediction held that the item
path would throw the identical assertion, since the demo hand-builds
`NSCollectionViewItem()` in `itemForRepresentedObjectAt` rather than calling `makeItem`.
**That is wrong.** The repro hand-built its items and survived, and the fixed demo runs
with the item path untouched. Apple enforces register+dequeue for **supplementary views
only**. Using `makeItem` remains better practice, but it is not required for
correctness and is not a crash risk — so the demo was left alone here.

**Files touched**

- `Demo/DemoApplication/main.swift` — `DemoFlowCollectionDataSource` (reuse
  identifiers, dequeue + full re-configuration, registration at the call site)

**Verified**

- macOS: built and **ran** — the launch crash is gone. This was the change that first
  got the shared demo running against real AppKit at all.
- Linux/Windows: depends on the matching framework API landing (Issue N); the
  WinChocolate half is written but **unverified** — no Win32 toolchain on this machine.
